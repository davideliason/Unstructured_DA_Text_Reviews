3,"Roast Coffee &amp; Eatery is a restaurant located at Seenspace Thonglor, located on the second floor. It is a medium size restaurant with around 10 tables. The wine cellar will have a bottle of wine hanging down from the ceiling, chic, black, and black. The chic of this shop is the first to see the menu is like a newspaper. Looks good in the picture, it&#39;s good for photography. It is a light refreshment. (1 reason why I want to eat this restaurant because of this chic menu. The food is better than the menu is Brunch and Dinner for me then open the back 5. Evening to go. The menu is considered to have a menu. Not too much for this time, but the menu is recommended to me that is. - Duck Confit Price 318 baht a duck legs. The deliciousness of this dish is The crust of duck and soft inside. There is also a raspberry or canary sauce. It&#39;s delicious, it&#39;s delicious, it&#39;s baked with a piece of bread. Delicious It is sweet, sour, perfect, recommend it delicious - Croque Monsieur Price 262Baht is a ham cheese bread. But cheese is more unusual than the top cheese and very accessible. For people who like to eat cheese is very much. The volume is very large. This plate - Vodka Arrabiatta Seafood Price 328 Baht is a spaghetti seafood tomato sauce. Smell of Vasea. I personally think that this menu is common. You can eat in the Italian restaurant. Does not stand out But what I like is to have a lot of seafood and scallops for me to see that the people eat a lot and look very nice. Strawberry Waffle Price 206 Baht Strawberry Waffle Honey is poured over it. Overall I feel that it is common. I have a general store. The price is not cheap and not too expensive for me. All 4 dishes cost 1,441 baht, because it has a 10% and 7% Vat. 1,224 Baht *** The beauty of the shop is that the water bottle is small to expensive.I like to drink 3 bottles of 40 baht, usually not to 10 baht, so I feel that the way to make their own water or imported water will make it feel better. If you think Thai water in the price than usual.",restaurant
4,"Eat from the children. The shop is opposite. Phra Prathat Convent The new expropriation was moved to the opposite side of the football field. At present, there are two restaurants in this area. Another brother&#39;s shop on Rama IV Road, near the old Klongtoey. The taste of these two restaurants is modest, although the original recipes from the ancestors are the same. The soup flavor is a very distinct feature of this restaurant. Chinese herbs and spices have been improved to smell and taste is unique from the shop. Do not be surprised to see the volume of people eat this store is different from the store kind of brother does not match. The sweetness of the salty.

I can not wait to go back to the top. So sit down It has more than 555. In front of you will see a large pot filled with soup and a box of options. Large enough table I have a 6 to 7 people. But we came alone. I sit on the big table, clean shop expect that the top is clearer than the bottom of it. At first, I went to have a brother in the glasses to walk in the courteous manner, very submissive. At first glance, the price of the menu is right next to the wall, and it&#39;s a little cramped, but it&#39;s expensive if it&#39;s good quality. There is a pot of meat. If so many people would have ordered. But today comes alone. I ordered a bowl is better than the price is 60-80 baht a single dish is 50-60 and 80 by type of food. The goat is sold at 200 baht (but today did not try) ==Order + flavor == - Stir-fried oyster sauce (80.-) ** This dish is served first. I will eat it hot. But really, I would like to serve with a cup of coffee because it will eat rice with a cup. Wait until the recipe begins to eat. Wait a minute, the meat is not too tasty. Very soft But not me. I know that it is a very good grade meat. The taste of this must be meticulous to do a lot of course. Stir in the sauce and do not add anything to it. The quantity supplied is compared to the price. If only by 40 baht, it is expensive. Oh well, the dish we ordered is a small dish. If you want to eat, I recommend. Oily oil Then ordered a separate rice. (I do not include rice steamed) - all the stuff (60.-) ** recommended. Because I want to eat another. When it comes to this, the smell is very spice. The soup is thickened until it thickens. The first word that sips puree is here. But we also cook.A little pepper is put. It&#39;s a bit of a sweet chili, it&#39;s really sweet and it&#39;s really delicious. The other thing that is &quot;everything&quot; in this bowl is the liver filling in the meat and everything else is really great. Especially the big ball of the restaurant to soften the taste of the meat out. The restaurant is both simmered and fermented meat is a very cool course. Have not eaten at this restaurant, this is delicious. - Small noodles meat ball (60.-) This bowl is plain. Tasty as well. The water is less concentrated than the bowl. Because hot noodles will absorb the concentration of water. The soft lines are normal. But that is a cool meatballs that come in. The overall taste is lighter than the gourmet bowl. Need to cook more I like the taste of the intensity. The food must wait about 15 minutes because the order is very much. It is a good idea to have a 10-20 bag at home.I see this price is strong enough to say that it is worth it. I will not be much. But it is worth the good and quality of this service. This is a Chinese restaurant that is better than the same style shop other stores (as already) because I have to eat this shop to order several. Most of the services are ... Do not see the customer&#39;s head much. But this shop is in reverse. The staff at the level I know, thank you always sorry. And well all over the table with me. Eat meat It&#39;s hard to chew. And blood group A will digest the red meat. à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ à¸—à¸²à¸™ I like to eat vegetarian. But this restaurant makes us fascinated with red meat. This area is not fatigue, stomach is not too heavy. Because of the meticulous attention to every step of the meat stew to soften. To smell the Chinese medicine. And the soup is thickened and boiled throughout the day. You said that. This is delicious and cheap. I&#39;m sorry This is delicious. This is not the case. The bestThere are many menus to try. View from other reviews. I have to wait for the party to eat a lot. Today, all 202. eat alone! I love the blueberry cheese pie. But fear of fat is more than this, I have to starve to taste it. The price is strong if compared with volume. But with flavor And good service (compared to the same style shop), then have to come again soon, this restaurant is 5 stars do not think hard! We are almost impeccable. But the word worth and worth! Who want to eat meat in the legendary. Where is the delicious? Prepare to clear the stomach and bag. Walk into this shop. Not disappointed of course !!",restaurant

Do not rush Do not rush to do anything but in reality. We can not do that. But it does not mean that. We have to have a life that always rotates clockwise. Because we can choose to stop our hands. This is the corner of the world. If we find a place that makes us feel calm and relaxed, and if you find a good one, then you will find that among the high buildings lined up. And a motorbike on the central Sukhumvit Road. It is one of Bangkok&#39;s major business and shopping districts. Just walk away from the Sukhumvit Soi 51 just 20 meters to a place that just opened the door ... The outside world will stop spinning down immediately .... When stepped into the store &quot;Agalago&quot;, this shop &quot;Agalco&quot; is located on the ground floor of the building &quot;Boon Jirat&quot; is a shop. Mom proudly proud of the long open road.The 14-year-old has opened a coffee shop and bakery for three days a week, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and Monday to Thursday opens the venue for pre-wedding photography. Or organize events. The opening only 3 days a week, this is one of the charm of the store. People are looking forward to the day when the restaurant is open for snacks and beverages. The most important charm of &quot;Agalco&quot; that made many people are the atmosphere is different from the world. I have a problem with that. Since stepping into the store. It will be influenced by the calmness of the bright white color that is constantly tinted throughout the shop. I also had a look at the green garden that surrounded the outside. If anyone goes in the sun, wind umbrella. It can take a walk, get oxygen from the shady trees in the garden. Decorated with Italian style geometry. And ancient statues of Bali. Mixed with Thai trees Big white pavilion The chairs are arranged in various angles under the umbrella as a deep garden.The secret to waiting for people to discover. And so indulge in that beauty till the time has passed. Relax with the timeless beauty. Order a light meal of &quot;Ham and Bacchus&quot; (120 Baht) packed with cheese, ham, bacon, mushroom, champagne and spinach served hot and fragrant. Hot tuna &quot;to sit at the same time to start the meal is not too heavy. Get the nutritional value as well as then, when the body begins to work with fishy foods. I ended up with a sweet dessert. It is the balance of the sweet taste of the cheese to the sweet taste of the crepe cake. Place the dough chocolate cake on top of the cream. Then topped with chocolate sauce. Or if you like to eat a cake, you have to order a &quot;carrot cake&quot; with a carrot filling in the cake. The sweetness of Carrot is well contrasted with the sourness of cream cheese top and middle of the cake. (Both crepes and cakes)It is a delicious end to order a hot tea aroma to sit and sip a pair of &quot;Agalco&quot; has a wide selection of brands such as Twining, TWG, Celestial Seasonings, Harrods, Royale Albert or Hediard.

And the wind outside is not bad at all. Average Price: 200-300 Baht Food Crisis: Hot Chocolate (110 Baht) Sweet taste is not rich, served with a small chocolate milk. Iced latte (110 baht) can be selected. Because the source. The taste is not like 110 baht, I think that is better than this. Maybe because the milk is used. Have less fat% London crape (245 baht) is a crepe with spinach and cream. Serve with salad The taste and texture of vegetables like spinach soup. Create my own Sandwich (220 baht). Three options in this price is better to order at the shop.

However, during the flood, the family moved to this place and gathered together to help flood victims. From that point on, I wanted to make this a center for social activities and initiated a coffee shop. Both businesses and the community have to walk together to become a coffee shop in the end, where the shop in addition to coffee, tea, milk and ï¿½ï¿½ Hmong cake.

350,"I did not know about this restaurant before ... but my high school friends used to say that this is a cool shop. Because there is only one table. We can not choose. I will be prepared. This means that reservations must be made in advance. At first I did not get much attention. I almost forgot the name. Good luck to see this review. I remember that it was a restaurant that my friend once said. The food that others post. It&#39;s a great place to eat. To arrange to try to name the store. &quot;One table,&quot; but now it&#39;s not the same table. There are 4 tables, each with 10-11 seats. There are 12 people in the table. I have 11 people to sit on the table. 10 people have not been uncomfortable. Really not that size. I booked Sunday before Songkran. The next week was. View user&#39;s profile Send private message The shop is not full all day. Have lunch and dinner. (The day I went to eat. I chose a dinner.I just have a table.) This store must be booked in advance. Another challenge is The appointment of friends to eat up to 10 people, because we have to book a long time, causing the uncertainty of each person to eat. If anyone has to turn to someone. The rest must pay for the damage immediately ... Forget that damage to a table is about 11,000-12,000 baht [location of the shop and parking] From roundabout 22 to the first alley straight to the intersection. Turn right and you will find the temple ... the opposite. Plubpla I recommend this park offline. Take 30 minutes to get to the park, walk out of the temple, go to the alley, stand at the mouth and look for a small alley. The car is not offline. Walk into it. The shop is in the alley. ] Is a small shop shop, open a glass door. One table is located. Yes, that&#39;s the name. Looking at the wall, there is a picture of Newsweek magazine that is stuck in this &quot;101 Best Place to eat around the world&quot; !!! ..The emphasis is on the menu &quot;steamed crab&quot; as well. [Food served. ] We can not choose the food we want. He will be prepared according to the number of people to advance. The food is served all 11 dishes ... almost all meat dishes are used to sea animals almost every menu. If you are allergic to seafood. This is because the signature dish of this restaurant is steamed crabs and is the most expensive menu of the meal to see the food I prepared for the table better. - Roasted ginkgo. (200.-) This dish I can not say that work? I did not come to this dish:) - Shrimp Dumplings (200.-) delicious this dish. - Duck smoked (300.-) This dish I do not like - Abalone Wasabi (600.-) Abalone is a beautiful sheet. The price - Snow fish (2,100.-). High prices, but the fish meat to eat more than 10 people can comfortably. I took the fish well. Fish fillet chewing beef sauce topped with vegetables to the sweetness of the vegetables out.- Crab Steaming 5x1,200 (6,000.-) This dish is the signature of the store. (And the most expensive) and not disappointed. There is a crab under the bottom. - Stir fried sea bream (600.-) This dish is another dish that I like. Sauce - XO Sauce (200.-) This menu is for me. I think the disadvantage of this meal. The taste is quite fresh. Fried rice (400.-) Not sure if the meat in the fried rice is ham and smoked duck meat? But this dish is another dish that I like. The food is very good. - Soup (500.-) Put a lot of fish and fresh fish. Also, when compared to fish meat - snow albino (300.-), this flavor is not as crispy as it should be. If it comes to framing, I would like it. Haha, this meal came out 11,920 baht, divided 11 people out to about 1100 baht each, but it is high compared to the quality of the raw materials he used to cook. Get it now.But I do not eat often. The gang is not easy to eat ... delicious overall. Have a dish that does not work. I&#39;m not sure if this is the case. I should try it once! I have to go to a slower store than anyone else.

353,"First off, I&#39;ve been eating this restaurant for about 2 years now, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of changes in this restaurant. This is my first choice for me. Salmon Sashimi is very fresh here. Serve with the boat on the ice. The freshness can be reached until you reach the mouth of the ramen and rice is a small bowl. Unlike other stores that are full in a single bowl. Desserts ** Green tea ice cream is very delicious, but !!! The shop changed a lot from the previous salmon pieces. Take a few pieces (in some dishes) for a long time to see a regular piece (the size should be made into a sashimi) and a beautiful pattern. The last round to go. The chef will take a break between beautiful and unattractive pieces. I have a mole. From the raw fish to the restaurant I have to eat it every time I eat. Time to eat it, too. Almost unlike the original. But the shop stopped serving on the boat with ice under it. If you have not eaten for a while. Salmon is not as delicious as the first. And understand that the chef now.Let&#39;s prepare a plate and put it. I do not know how to do it. It is clear like green tea in a bottle. But I see the staff to replenish. Let&#39;s go to the press. It looks very intense. So I went to try again. More delicious than offline. Do not know what&#39;s going on. If the restaurant does not mix the formula (darker than usual), it&#39;s not the quality of the customer. &quot;It&#39;s not good for both of us&quot;. (I think it may have been from a mixed restaurant a lot, and then left. When enough green tea is left, it will overwhelm. I do not have time to pour into the tank before. The first tank, but clear water. The back of the bottle is very concentrated.) Green tea ice cream is gone !! The green tea icecream to dessert. Personally think that the store is intended to reduce costs. Did you know that the most delicious salmon with green tea ice cream, the old staff lost. At first, I started to get a student internship. I understand that the kids are off school.But enough to go around Old staff lost. But the students part time only. Chief size and cashier are also changed. I do not know if the chef is changed. The way to do fish is not the same, how to reduce the cost of the product impact on the quality of products and services, so many of my friends stop eating. Or change to a sequential store to choose. When I first had to eat 1-3 times a month, this is almost impossible to do offline.",restaurant

Before entering the shop must have been washing with alcohol before. For the safety of my sister. And if you find that the seat is not available, the store will be available to leave the phone. When there are empty seats and queues, there will be a call. During the waiting time, you can play with the dog at the garden before.

The concept of the drink in the bar to drink a menu like &quot;Balcony On The Rock Extra Milk&quot; (55 baht) at this time Arabica coffee.Grapefruit concentrate in ice form with refreshing milk. We can determine the intensity of the coffee flavor by adding milk. It is an interesting coffee and it is believed to be a coffee, but if you do not like coffee or just want a little coffee flavor here is &quot;Sweet and Bitter&quot; (55 baht). With espresso, soft and delicious. When I was drinking on the white spinning milk is a beautiful pattern. This menu is similar to Mocha Gelato, the introduction of Vanilla Gelato (Gelato is Italian, meaning ice cream. However, the appearance of this type of ice cream is more viscous than the low-rise, which is different from the typical ice cream), topped with espresso. There are many homemade cakes here ... &quot;Fondant Chocolate&quot; (95 baht) Chocolate candy, but called by name. French fondue comes with ice cream, vanilla and whipping. This fondant must say that rub.Chocolate lovers love it. Here, he put in a very concentrated chocolate, and put the yolks and butter over. (Put the egg yolks and chocolate down, and the frosting cream will be even more tasty.) The flour mixture is very little. Dine with ice cream and whipped and mix well with &quot;Tramisu&quot; (70 baht). Top is a layer of Mascarpone Mousse (this mousse is made from Mascarpone Cream Cheese, which is a fresh cheese. The name of the Lombardy region of Italy is not solid. But like a thick cream, whipped up, crisp, ivory-free, no cheese smell. Sweet taste of lactose in milk. It is best to make dessert or mixed with fruit.) Sprinkle Cocoa Powder on the bottom is a soft cake flour Genoise Sponge. Sweet taste is good, not greasy, suitable for people who love to eat light cake and close at the end. &quot;Strawberry Cake&quot; (65 THB) Cake Menu But here is the difference that he developed a formula. Normally, in cream, he uses mascarpone cheese, but uses a different cheese flavor to make it more flavorful.Thin sheet It has been modified for a long time. The sauce is also a mixture of strawberry sauce and topped with the sauce that the restaurant brought the original seasoning with just icing sugar. The menu is another cake to me. Who are looking for Chic coffee shop, Chic concept, drink menu, or go to Srinakarin. Let&#39;s go to this place and look at his ideas and delicious food. This restaurant has a dessert workshop. Who would like to make a cake, family, friend or lover here, he will start teaching from the start to beat the eggs to accomplish a piece and take pictures during the make.

However, it looks quite over-sized to me, eating alone, as I'll have dinner with my girl gangs after this.Thus, this time I eventually order soft cream (2 style: charcoal and green-tea) with fruit topping, mochi, green-tea gelatin and, of course, black mashed bean. You have to eat it with syrup made from granulated brown sugar. All the ingredient is just okay compatible and I really enjoy the black bean most. Hmm, from my experience here I must say that parfait dishes can be trusted. There's more chance of deliciousness than the soft cream I think. ",restaurant

We have free books &amp; free wifi service.Flavor, Food and Drink: This time, try to order 4 cakes. The taste and softness of the cake is soft and delicious. If it is, it would be chocolates. The fudge cake is a little hard to drink, it is a cool cappuccino coffee. This is my personal favorite. Price: Cake Price per piece at 70-100 à¸¿ Drinks from 50 to over.

The service is excellent, the owner and the staff are very attentive, the food is not to mention. So much to be shocked. Not just lines But let&#39;s all over the bowl! In the menu, if you add 50.-, you will get a very large bowl, eat 3 people, but the ramen here is a little salty, like other dishes like Omu soba or cold meats are delicious. Fermentation is very good, and the restaurant is open late with me. Hungry late at night. If you go to work after a lot of people. Both Japan and Thailand. Price includes today 318.- with a delicious ramen that is full of a woman to eat a ramen just a cup of tea. This is probably the most expensive. Do not miss this one!The volume and value of the menu is not the Ramen. Next time will order another menu that is salty, greasy less than this. But the main thing is delicious for us.

I have a feeling when I eat the first time I know the other. It is a Chinese haw which lives in southern China. Most of them are in Yunnan. The border between Thailand and Laos They live in the mountains and in the city. In Hong Kong, Chinese people often live in Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, Lampang and Phayao, and even in Burma themselves are influenced by Thai and Lao Khao Soi as well. The food is so simple that it is not as delicious as Khao Soi in Chiang Mai. But it is considered as well. The highlight is the menu of rice and noodles, but other than that, I was grateful that the pickled vegetables that are served with the rice cracker of this restaurant looks like it used to eat in the restaurant Ma, if called. Luxury is a bit like Kimchi in the Burma. It is a pickle. It has a red pepper mixed with.Popular with many dishes such as rice, firewood, Myanmar Burmese style noodles I believe that eating is not easy at all. 35-55, then there will be chicken, pork and fish fillets will be 70 to not more than 100 baht. Chicken rice is 45 baht, the line is quite different from the rice, Lampang and Chiang Mai. The line is similar to the yellow jelly noodles. But not bad chicken is a piece of meat. I like to eat a chicken as a chicken more than a curry to a little concentration on the still. If not, then this dish is up to a little more ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

481,"On the Table is a fusion restaurant. Japanese, Italian, Zen, many people familiar with each other very well. This is because we see a sofa with a soft pillow to sit in. It is notable that there are people who attend the fair at Central Ladprao. Can park the car and then down to the 1st floor or MRT. At the entrance to the store, you will see this store before this store. The owner was sitting in a small cafe. One of the central Tokyo. After a day trip He felt the warmth. This small cafe is not a luxury. But the chic and warm Homemade mood, which is hidden charms and strange fusion food in Japan, this is the most popular. On the table is the origin of the &quot;Happiness is on the table&quot; and the highlight of the store. Foods that are designed to be different, easy to eat, but must offer a homemade to communicate with. Modern Japanese It is designed to convey the atmosphere in the shop. Full of odorsBlend the warmth of a smooth cafe. Scandinavian style The color of the wood is light white with a clear view, the outside is a clear glass. People are walking to walk. The wall is painted with a story about food with a pen. Out of the cartoon. And when you look around, be it spoon spoons, wooden trays or even tissues. Everything is going to be the best of it all. There are many angles to choose from. There are tables available. There are about 30-40 tables in the menu. The menu is said to be Tokyo Cafe. Menu can not escape Japanese food. It is a Japanese food that mixes the menu Mix &amp; Match out to chic to eat it. Covered with pale cloth. Like a small food book. Beautifully designed with pastel tones. I also have a picture to eat it. I have a Bowl / Spoon served in a variety of food. Whether it be sushi, curry, spaghetti, steak and children&#39;s menu, I recommend it.This is a lot of view from the menu here is not quite right, but the hit would not escape the rice curry. Hamburger Curry Gratin (270.-) ** Recommended ** with cheese On a large plate served hot, the smell of cheese on the top is a soft burger on top of the rice and then tasted the Japanese curry flavor is full of aroma and cheese that makes chewing long. The pork burger is soft, very good. Scorched slightly, the smell of meat is much more. It&#39;s good to eat with Japanese, it is recommended to eat hot. This menu is very good with cheese lover, but if you do not like the cheese, you may think that it is greasy and the curry is very good. - Ebi Yaki Pasta ( 220.-) served in a plate Spaghetti with Stir Fried Yogurt Sauce It also increases the salinity of eggs with shrimp. Small I think that I like yogurt. Spaghetti with egg and shrimpFour other dishes are not impressed. If you like it, you will not regret it. There will be another flavor to help with. Not a salted egg. But this dish is a recommend dish of the restaurant. - Clam Cheese Croquette (140.-) This menu here. We are very proud to be able to do that. Another Japanese restaurant that I have eaten. I do not eat it in the meat cut it. It is a very nice cream with a dip and a little sweet and not disappointed. Very mellow But why is it in the cold? The outside is very hot. But in the heat like to take it. If the inside is hot. This dish is recommended to me. Because the size is cool and delicious. Vanilla Fruit Parfait (110.-) Vanilla Fruit Parfait I ordered a green tea instead. Serve a very large cup. Good price with this menu. But like no ice cream left out of Freeman. It&#39;s hard to scoop. Have to waitWith peaches And strawberry A little sauce. Below is a normal whipped cream. Very ordinary You can order desserts as well. There are also many other great menus such as Norway Chirashi, Parma maki, Tokyo Salad or Apple crumble or Caramel Bread Pudding and many others. I thought about missing a dessert. How to order? The food is not very long with this branch. When I sit down, I have a basket of cutlery. The atmosphere is good and very comfortable. We have a sofa in .. good service. I do not like this because we are picking up food. I do not think that SC is worth it. The service is not very good. Compare prices and quantities. Not worth much. The curry dish is very large. But the bottom is also embossed. It is a story. I see that after you finish. It&#39;s a nice place to sit and sleep. The menu has many options. But the taste and quality of the food is mostly dormant. The price is high, it just sells. And the differenceThe quality of food depends on the branch. Day by day up and down the people, but the store is still clean. The other advantages are obvious today, the price is 841 baht to eat two people 420 baht per person feel full of atmosphere. And the taste of curry just a plate. This is a great place to hang out. I do not think it&#39;s a good thing to have a sc, but if it&#39;s sc, then I think it would be an exclusive service. Can not access The risk is easy to slip it.",restaurant

502,"In the summer, go to Bali with friends. Rottweiler woke up at five in the morning and took a spider boat out to sea. To see the dolphins. I have never seen dolphins before except TV or dolls. Just remember that the smile of the dolphins is the biggest misunderstanding of mankind. This tells us that this should be derived from the phrase &quot;Dolphin Smile&quot; is the most illusory disguise in the world. The impression of the dolphins in my heart is lovely and sweet, accompanied by the early morning of Rottweiler and the bright yellow clouds of the sky. The dolphins jumped out of the sea in the morning light and were chased by a boat. The boat followed the direction in which the dolphins appeared. I couldn&#39;t help thinking, why should we chase, not wait? The dolphins were trapped in this bay full of boats. Because we were in a hurry, we were too attached to the encounter with the dolphins. I knew very early that there was a documentary about Dolphin Bay, but it took a long time to think about it. Documentaries are easy to be pre-positioned. I suspect that Dolphin Bay will lead to moral controversy, but I don&#39;t want to even mention the value orientation of Americans. I have also seen people say, &quot;In the name of fraternity, it divides everything into three or six, etc., which is essentially a cheap and self-deceptive value.&quot; Many times people think about a question, what is the balance between animals and humans. In fact, all creatures are just different levels of the food chain, so why do you have beef and pork on the table, but you shouldn&#39;t have dolphins, dogs? Just because we don&#39;t know, the dolphins and dogs are in what position. If you want to go deeper into this issue, I am afraid you have to set up another article. &quot;We should not eat dolphin meat&quot; may not be universal value, but it is the clear values â€‹â€‹we see in Dolphin Bay. But I have to say that it &quot;self-deception&quot;, but I feel funny. After the formation of a personal world view, I will guide my behavior: Should I, should I, kill? Eat dolphins? Don&#39;t talk about the hollowness of the object level, just talk about your own value judgment. Put aside the philosophical significance of specific issues. We should not stand on the judgment standards of the public. At least for ourselves, those in the film, including me outside the film, are deeply guilty of this massacre. This is just a choice made in the personal morality. Isn&#39;t Dolphin Bay not to evoke people&#39;s compassion, but to make people think about the status of dolphins and dogs, cattle and sheep? Even shortening the death time of dolphins has become a gift. Like a dolphin, &quot;You give me a good time.&quot;So, humans answered &quot;Okay, I am satisfied with you.&quot; It is cruel kindness. Of course, from the shooting, &quot;Dolphin Bay&quot; has an inevitable American-style lyric. It may not be completely fair and objective, but also to achieve its purpose. The material that is good for itself. Fortunately, the ending we see is that the purpose is achieved. This is not the sublimity of human nature, but the persistence of humanity when it comes to ugliness. It is just that I feel that practicing my own values â€‹â€‹is a It&#39;s a very difficult thing. I don&#39;t know how many people are trying to defend their hearts. They are willing to go to prison many times. They are willing to stand on the streets for a long time. Everyone has their own value judgments. I think most people have no time to correct them. The world view of others. As for those who read a documentary, they can only see &quot;propaganda&quot;, and then go to obscenity &quot;Americans&#39; obscenity&quot;, but it is the bullshit with the correct political direction. In addition, &quot;Dolphin Bay&quot; has overemphasized creation. The subjective expression of suspicion, but after all, promoted people&#39;s thinking about the event itself, and obtained a goodwill result.",movie
503,"The name &quot;Today&quot; probably has the positive meaning of &quot;live in the moment&quot; because &quot;Today is yesterday&#39;s tomorrow.&quot; In comparison, I prefer the English translation A Reason to Live. Many people have never spent a moment to think about the reasons for living. We have health, family, love, career, wealth, etc., and we have one of them. So life is so lucky, there is no need for a reason to support yourself to live. Until the things we value, they lose the same...not even all, just the same. â€œLostâ€ is like the pillar of the building being taken away, and it collapses a little bit in our lives. Song Huiqiao played the role of Du Hui from his parents divorced, did not understand the family warmth, until the love given by her boyfriend became a very important part of life. When love surpasses other possessions as the most important component, it becomes both a reason to live and the original intention of self-murder. So the loss of this part is like a knife in the heart. Life can&#39;t help but encounter such a vicious moment. When she loses her love, she begins to think about how to live. Paradoxically, in this case, Duohui easily forgave the murderer and wrote a petition to take care of the future of the underage child. On the surface, it supports the reason for living, from love to forgiveness. But I don&#39;t think that this movie just discusses &quot;forgiveness&quot; with us. Chi Min, a girl who seems to be rebellious and is extremely clever, has begun to question the act of understanding of the heroine. This character is also the highlight of the film, constantly interrogating religion, ethics, violence and the meaning of life from the perspective of a girl. At the same time, as an audience, we may ask ourselves, if we suffer the same harm, can we just forgive those who hurt us in the name of the Lord? My answer is no. Because of our humanity, there is love and hate. Here, I can&#39;t help but think that this film is a mockery of the deception of religion. There was a shot in the film, and Huihui tried to suppress the anger and stared at Jesus on the cross. Finally, he ran out hysterically and asked the priest. &quot;When Jesus was crucified and dying, Jesus asked God to forgive his enemies. In the case of forgiveness to God for his enemies, isn&#39;t Jesus as a victim not forgiving his enemies, and God can&#39;t forgive his enemies?&quot; The priests and nuns in the film constantly exhort the perpetrators, Based on the simple &quot;you are a tolerant person&quot; is obviously untenable. As an atheist, I thought about it.The meaning of religion. When do we need a religious belief. Put aside the exchange conditions that &quot;I make a wish to you, please give me... I will...&quot;, only those beliefs from a sincere heart. On the one hand, faith replaces morality to give behavioral standards. This standard of goodness has an educated meaning and makes society more stable. On the other hand, when people are weak and certain, they need to have faith to save and give spiritual things. comfort. I also have to say that the spiritual power is beyond people&#39;s imagination. On the contrary, our education gives moral principles outside the law. When we have enough happy life, life gives us enough power, and we don&#39;t need to rely on religious belief to support our lives. The multi-hui in the film is also because after losing the original support, under the guidance of the faith, trying to relieve the inner pain through forgiveness. &quot;Because God wants us to forgive anyone, forgiveness makes us forget hatred, and without hatred we can gain inner peace.&quot; Such logic is a bit like religious self-deception. The principleless understanding is actually unforgiving, and the &quot;principle&quot; given by the film is the confession of the perpetrator. In fact, this kind of remorse is also of religious significance. Then, another clue in the film, the life of the rebellious girl Chi Min surfaced. The first best is also the victim of domestic violence for the judgeâ€™s father. This reveals an issue of ethics and violence. In the Eastern family, South Korea, like China, attaches great importance to ethical blood. This is reflected in the fixed thinking mode of â€œfostering more than the skyâ€ and â€œparents are always rightâ€ and â€œfollowing the filial son under the stickâ€. Chi Minâ€™s question is: â€œParents hit their daughters to cause their death, saying that itâ€™s a manâ€™s murder. The crime is lighter than the intentional murder. In turn, the daughter kills and beats his parents every day. How do you guess it?â€ Ethics gave an excuse for violence. Just because he owes his bones. Rebellion is a violation of the usual. Fortunately, the laws of modern society give children a weapon to defend their rights. But ironically, Chi Minâ€™s father is a justice judge. At the same time, he must show off his daughter&#39;s excellence to others, and he must continue to impose violent behavior. The film did not explain the pathological psychological roots behind Chi Minâ€™s father, but barely exposed the cruelty of this blood. Similarly, because of ethics, the fact that parents have concealed their sonâ€™s sexual assault on their daughters has led to aggravation of her daughterâ€™s departure from her family. At this point, I can&#39;t help but tremble. Law, ethics, and religion can&#39;t effectively protect the right to life. Several quarrels between Duo Hui and Chi Min in the film represent two worlds.View. The multi-hui reversed to accept the weak resistance of Chi Min, the same thing, neither of them let the hatred sprout in the ugly background. Chi Minâ€™s thinking is how to live in the hands of a tyrannical father. She even gave her parents a &quot;parental identification book&quot; in an attempt to prove that she was not a parent, as a reason to forgive each other (and to live on their own). The families of the victims in the film have one thing in common. They need the apology of the perpetrators, and they are sincerely forgiven. As a result, they did not get a &quot;sorry&quot;. This &quot;sorry&quot; is too broad, and the victim&#39;s request for the confession of the perpetrator is very passive, and the apology from the heart is only superficial, not the same as true regret. Going back to that religious proposition, forgiveness is actually a reduction in the load of your own mind. As for the prisoner, there may be no burden on the conscience. But even so, no matter what the world gives, we always have to live in good faith. Like the two heroines.",movie

505,"The French philosopher Deleuze used the &quot;capitalism and schizophrenia&quot; as the general title to analyze the current social situation in the Western world. After reading &quot;Lone Ranger&quot;, I thought it could also be placed under the framework of this &quot;schizophrenia&quot;. To discuss, of course, I can&#39;t understand the deep thoughts of philosophers, that is, to pull the banner as a tiger skin, the word does not reach his intentions, and it is good for me. How many new tricks have been created by the fistula? In terms of type, &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; is still a western movie. The style and meaning of the western film can be interpreted by anyone, but in the final analysis, it is necessary to extend the story in the context of colonialism. All can be changed, the basic elements of colonial expansion, cowboy vigilance, and the contradiction between whites and aborigines are indispensable. However, time has passed, colonialism has become post-colonialism (globalization), and the western tide has already died down. If it is said, &quot;Unforgivable&quot; and &quot;Dance with the Wolf&quot; still have the last blood of the western film. In the movie &quot;Lango&quot; and &quot;Lone Ranger&quot;, the &quot;Western Film&quot; itself has become a kind of image that is &quot;satisfied&quot; by the patina. What is fatal is that you can&#39;t face your face and pay a serious tribute. It can only be slightly stretched in the ridicule of irony. &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; has a high &quot;generationality&quot; in the western film story. As early as 1933, there was a radio drama, and it has been repeatedly adapted into film and television drama, game animation and other forms in the popular culture of the United States, including 1949. ~ In 1957, the American ABC television network had broadcasted a total of 221 episodes of the 221 episodes of the TV series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. In the 1950s, it became the famous character of &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; in American film and television culture. The prototype of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; is not complicated. It is a cowboy hero who swayed and punishes the good in the west. After wearing the Zorro-style eye mask, the true identity of the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; was concealed. Get up and become the protagonist of the story, the Indian Donto around him is just a helper for the hero?? Holmes needs Watson, Batman needs Robin, this is the routine (in the earliest radio drama Donto until the first The 11th episode appeared, the original creator said that this character is purely to find a partner for the protagonist). However, in this &quot;Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; can&#39;t &quot;lone alone&quot;. The wise man of the white protagonist is far less attractive than the Indian assistant Tango&#39;s fake idiot. It has strong Indian origin. Nie Depu undoubtedly poured a new soul into the corner of Donto, from the shape to the insideIt is very different from the classic Donto image in the ABC drama series (the original Donto is neither shirtless nor painted on the top of the head and there is no &quot;angry bird&quot;). The white protagonist in the film is almost in the face of Donto. Breathing, this is almost exactly the same as &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;? Depp&#39;s performance is reminiscent of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, the combination of producer Bruchheimer and Disney is reminiscent of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, the implantation of Disneyland The propaganda is also reminiscent of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. Unfortunately, the box office results are hard to hope for &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; suffered a heavy box office defeat, and it is said that it directly promoted Brookheimer and Disney&#39;s parting ways. &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; has greatly enhanced the depiction of Indian traditional culture, the legend of &quot;Soul of the Soul&quot;, the history of blood and tears of silver mines, the influence of the eccentric &quot;Wendigo&quot;, these mysterious aboriginal cultural elements are like tablets Like the carnivorous rabbit, it is so bright that it cannot be integrated into the narrative pattern. The tribute and irony, blood and spoof, white and indigenous, history and legend, and even the drama function between the two protagonists can not be completely clear, so &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; left a schizophrenic in the &quot;lost&quot; of colonialism Back view, under the current &quot;political correct&quot; background of racial diversity and the ubiquitous &quot;humanitarian&quot; concept, the old narrative structure of the old western film was badly hurt, but the new structure was delayed. Depp&#39;s performance is like a double-edged sword. It can shine in Tim Burton, but it seems to be out of place in works like &quot;Lone Ranger.&quot; &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; began with a little boy&#39;s experience of visiting the circus exhibition. As a &quot;exhibition&quot;, Donto began to tell the story of his true and false, perhaps, this already foreshadowed the film (and its representative western The fate of the film?

509,"According to the scale of investment, &quot;The Avengers&quot; can only be regarded as a B-rated film. The low cost limits the film&#39;s inability to use expensive stunts to create visual wonders. Of course, there is no such need. It does not deliberately provoke and stimulate the senses of the audience with violent bloody grotesque plots and pictures, but calmly tells a story of revenge and hunting, redemption and forgiveness. Some lenses look relatively rough, but one The intentional use enhances the texture and authenticity of the film. The well-designed storyline and the strength of the actors have made the quality of The Vengeance much better than the average B-level film. According to the content, &quot;The Enemy&quot; is a typical cult film. The director&#39;s stylization is very strong. It is quite experimental and innovative. Although there are still many shortcomings in the film, it is worthy of recognition. To some extent, the &quot;Heroes&quot; narrative technique is a bit like the well-received &quot;National Witness&quot; of the previous period. It is progressively stripped and layered, with an unexpected mystery to overthrow the subjective judgments of the audience. The film&#39;s temperament and image style is a bit like &quot;Border Front&quot;. The ace photographer Huang Yuetai&#39;s shooting style is exquisite and unique, the lens is cold and the color is rich, giving a feeling of depression and tension from beginning to end. The old play bones Wu Zhenyu and Fan Shaohuang played the avengers and atonementers respectively. The story lines of the two were independent but entangled. Although there were not many action scenes and fighting scenes, it was indeed a genuine hard-core movie. . Wu Zhenyu&#39;s avengers are indifferent and aloof, while Fan Shaohuang&#39;s sinners are temperamental, and the two men with different personalities have changed from the initial confrontation to the last friend. The transformation process is complicated and intriguing. The effort of the creators of the film. In the film, Wu Zhenyu splits and complexes a character. The writer who is kind but has to avenge his wife and daughter through violence has been extremely wonderful. His expression is mixed with pain and contradiction. People are both scared and distressed. . And Fan Shaohuang is no longer willing to abandon his best-fashioned hard-fashioned performance. Although he is still a young and curious person with a machete, but as a great sinner, he will distort and even distort the character. The complex psychological interpretation is in place. Wu Zhenyu and Fan Shaohuang are also one of the highlights of the film. Of course, there are also some wonderful performances like Lin Xue, which add a lot to the film. The Chinese film market seems to be getting more and more popular, and movies of various themes and types are emerging one after another.With the improvement of the film, the competition in the domestic film market is becoming more and more fierce, and the audience&#39;s requirements for the quality of the film are getting higher and higher. If you want to share a piece of the cruel market, you can&#39;t touch the audience without thinking. Looking at so many domestic films every year, there are still a few that really impress people. The film works with good reputation and box office are rare. Most domestic films are too rough and can only be used. In the brutal market competition, it became a cannon fodder. There are still many shortcomings in The Enemy, but the meticulous intentions of the film and the innovative spirit of the experiment are indeed worthy of recognition. On the surface, the film tells the story of a resurgence of resentment with a heavy taste. In fact, it still shows the complexity and change of humanity to the public.

511,"After watching the whole movie, I realized that Jiang Ye said at the premiere: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect it to be such a hard movie when I took the film.&quot; There are too many fights in this movie (all of them are particularly large in space and very fast in speed). ), special effects (for special effects, the actors must be very troublesome to perform). The movie lasting more than 2 hours is really a parabola. . . The beginning is very good, the rhythm and the actors&#39; performances are worthy of the words &quot;action comedy&quot;. Later, it is getting worse and worse, more and more empty, more and more unnecessary, and even if it is not Jiangâ€™s arrogant and cool. When I fly in the sky from time to time, I really canâ€™t stand it. In my heart, Jin Yunxi is really NO.1 in the Korean power faction, even more than Uncle Song Kangxi. Even in this comedy, there is no side to it. Jiang Ye, I have to learn more with Jin Yunxi&#39;s predecessors. Lin Xiujing&#39;s line is too weak, and the five hundred years of Tian Zhizhi and the little widow are too understated. and. . . Uncle Jin Yunxi had a kiss with Lin Xiujing. . . Xiao Yi was well-received by Tian Yizhi on the elevator. The person stood back on the elevator and watched Tian Yizhi return. I like this kind of scene scheduling. Finally went to the beach, Jiang&#39;s head wearing a hat, wearing a white shirt, black long harem pants can not cover the long legs. . . Slobber. . .",movie
512,"From the beginning to the end, from the first death sentence to Jiang Ye, the director and the screenwriter seem to be the subject of anti-death penalty. Li Naying, the female host, tried to commit suicide three times. Jiang was willing to accept the death penalty. The last two people were reluctant to die because of that love. Jiang Ye is really cute in the inside, ugly and ugly. But when I recalled my girlfriendâ€™s past, the long-haired Jiang Ye was really a beautiful man. The eyes of a bow-shaped hairpin on the glass wall of the hair salon were too gentle. How I love you so recently! Wen Youzhen knows that when Yin Zhu wants to execute the death penalty, going to the hospital to forgive the mother is really tearful. Wen Youzhen said: &quot;If God knows, he will understand that forgiving you is far more difficult than suicide.

513,"After all kinds of drafts and singing programs have been captured for a long time, they have finally been screened by a cottage. &quot;Where is Dad?&quot; &quot;The water is successful. The discerning eye knows that this late-night broadcast of the father-son/female interactive exchange drama is just a change of the star show of the package, but it still can&#39;t stop listening to the song and hear the audience who want to vomit. Many of my female friends around me were the first to post &quot;Wow, I want to have a baby&quot; or &quot;Wow, I want to be a father&quot; in Weibo and WeChat. Although the recently released &quot;National Witness&quot; has been widely praised by many people as a mainland legal drama that has not been seen for many years, it is actually a story about father and daughter, instilling fatherly love above everything else, and &quot;Where is Dad going?&quot; The story of the same journey. After the loss of his wife, the local tyrants used the only daughter as the jewel of the palm. They never thought that because of the new love in the bed, the two women had a gap between them and even hatred. Thus, when two women broke out for a man with different purposes, the tragedy came. The underage daughter was killed in the garage, and the local tyrant was shocked and tried his best to save her daughter in court. The film started from the live broadcast before the court, and the clues of the light and the dark began. In the face, the local tyrants rushed to the domestic team of lawyers in an attempt to legally and logically defeat the prosecutors who had always been prejudiced against his rich man; in the dark, the local tycoons borrowed their own kind capital and money capital. Complete the Rashomon-style certificate of person and physical evidence, and wait quietly for the &quot;prey&quot;. Just the core of the story in the movie, the reversal of several layers can be described as intention. However, a movie is a logical collection of hundreds of minutes of video images. A good idea of â€‹â€‹suspenseful reasoning cannot support the entire countertop. The control of the picture rhythm did not keep up with the tension of the murder itself. The rigid single on the lens switch reduced the texture of the film to the level of the TV series, which undoubtedly exposed the director&#39;s incompatibility from the TV series. This short board is more reflected in the selection and guidance of the actors. In the man, there is no smell of gold lawyers. How to look at the frosty face and thick lips is like a captain of the criminal investigation wearing a suit; as a representative of the rich generation of the local Sun Honglei, the same frosty face performance and the &quot;I will die behind the dragon&#39;s back wall&quot;, personally think that he has not yet entered the role of the heart; as for Guo Fucheng, not warm, no surprise; and from the beginning to the end of Deng Jiajia There is no space to express the so-called wealthy second generation of money and alternative rebellion, so that the last father&#39;s redemption and his repentance are born with no credibility. I am not quite sure about China Court.The specific details of the trial, so there is no need to discuss whether there is a need for the Justice of the Dragon and the Dragon. However, too much detail in the production level of the TV series makes people feel sorry for the mistakes made by the investors in the balance of investment. The rigor of the physical evidence is placed on the squad of the original defendant, especially As the prosecution of Guo Fucheng, the story of the local tyrant Sun Honglei was confessed, and it was a blue sky that made people directly pass through the film of the ninth division of Zhou Xing&#39;s &quot;Nine Pieces of Sesame Officials&quot;. This kind of A said that I am the murderer or the murderer. B said that the causal relationship that I immediately released as a murderer is ridiculous. Even if the law in the real world is like a play, your film practitioners cannot be so realistic and restore irony. This reminds me of an old joke: I heard that Mongolia wants to build a marine park, and there are good people who ask, &quot;Do you have a sea here? What is the whole thing?&quot;, the other party is happy, saying, &quot;You still have so many courts. What? Why don&#39;t you say &quot;Jokes are jokes, we can&#39;t be too picky about a successful movie about a story.&quot; After all, in the last heavy rain, the father risked the crime of perjury and decided to change his life. He touched the vulnerable and sensitive people. This selfless fatherly love is not something that everyone can do??----- -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------PS The only thing that is globally unique is the notebook of your prosecution.

Afuâ€™s account was stolen too easily; the black fox was smothered but it was a bit too much; the technical difficulty of the four shows of the four knights was staggering; the man made a lot of extra moves for revenge, motivation, purpose, The technique is not uniform.

516,"After reading the novel, I watched the TV series of Wu Qihua and Su Youpeng. The TV series of Su Youpeng has been seen several times, so when I read this novel, the character image in the TV series naturally appeared in my mind. It was also because of Su Youpeng&#39;s TV series that Gao Yuanyuan became the goddess in my eyes. When I watched the TV series, I saw the end still thinking, it should be Zhou Yiruo and Zhang Wuji. The Su Youpeng version of the TV series restored the original version of the triple version to the greatest extent. When I read the novel, apart from Song Qingshu, I felt that the other castings were almost no problem, and they all matched the characters in the book. The biggest change is two. One is that Zhao Min and Zhang Wuji had a relationship when they were young. Zhang Wuji was met by the Yuan Bing and they both met. The second is that Xie Xunâ€™s stalking Zhou Yuruoâ€™s stolen sword on the Snake Island Not knowing. The origins of Guo Wei and Zhang Sanfeng did not appear in many TV series. The triple version of the Eternal Dragon Slayer I think it is very good at the beginning and end. At the beginning, there are the aftertastes of the eagle eagle and the god eagle. The paving of some scenery depicts a very grand story background, as if the characters in the audience have deep roots. Only then did not appear as elaborate in the sculpture. Every play written in the eagle eagle is especially in place. As long as there is a previously laid-back figure in a scene, then the drama conflict about him is indispensable, not like the latter half of the eagle and most of the heavens. Single-view descriptions appear to avoid conflicts. The final end of the triple version is Zhang Wujiâ€™s thrush for Zhao Min. Zhou Ruoâ€™s chuckle outside the window, Zhang Wujiâ€™s hand trembles, and a pen falls on the table. Itâ€™s very evocative, itâ€™s still unfinished. Among the five young women in the book, and Zhang Wujiâ€™s childhood, Zhou Ruoruo, Yin Li and Yang did not regret it. It is said that the source is extremely deep or Zhou Ruoruo and Yang do not regret. Hanshui, Zhou Ruruo had the right to feed the meal in Zhang Wuji, Zhang Zhenren brought Zhou Ruruo back to Wudang, and sent it to Emei, which is considered to have two layers of fate. Zhang Wuji was given the support of Ji Xiaofu. He sent Yang to the Guangming Mountain in Kunlun Mountain. During the period of several months, he was hunger and cold, and he was bullied. The two were considered to be happy. Yin Li and Zhang Wuji are the fate of one side, but Yin is a lifetime. Zhang Wuji learned to become a Jiuyang Zhenjing, fell to the top of the mountain, and began a trip to the rivers and lakes. The first encounter was the Yin away from his own side, and then Zhou Yiruo later saw Yang Yongfu and Xiao Zhao at the same time. The first to see Zhao Min is in the Xiliang Green Liu Villa. Yang does not regret and Zhang Wuji, when he was a child, he went hand in hand, and the two small ones lived together, which can be regarded as a deep feeling.Based on the feelings, after seeing Zhang Wuji, Zhang Wuji did not have a feeling with Zhang Wuji. After Wu Wushanâ€™s Zhang Wujiâ€™s interpretation of Wudang, she and Zhang Wuji said that she liked Yin Liting. That paragraph was very moving: â€œIâ€™m a brother, what was my childhood? Everything tells you, I want to eat a biscuit, I will tell you; I saw a sugary person on the road, and I told you. At that time, we couldnâ€™t afford it, you stole it in the middle of the night. &quot;Do you still remember?&quot; Yang did not regret that he did not like Zhang Wuji. For a story, it was a blessing for Yang to regret it. If you are obsessed with Zhang, you are afraid. It is also as unfortunate as Xiao Zhao Zhou. The longest time to get along with Zhang Wuji was Xiao Zhao, but Xiao Zhao left the earliest. As a personal close-knit of Zhang Wuji, Xiaozhao only wants to be really unscrupulous, but he does not have many demands on Zhang Wuji like Zhao Min and Zhou Ruruo. Jin Yong said that the most popular among the four women is Xiao Zhao. In fact, it is the virtuousness of Zhong Xiaozhao. Xiao Zhaoâ€™s desire to control and possessiveness is extremely weak. Therefore, for Zhang Wuji of Huaxin, Xiao Zhao is naturally the best as an acolyte. After Xiao Zhao, the long time to accompany Zhang Wuji is Zhou Yiruo and Zhao Min. On the Snake Island, Xiao Zhaoyuan walked to Persia. After Yin and Zhao Min disappeared, Zhang Wuji and Zhou Yiru had a long relationship. This fate went from overseas to Zhangzhou wedding. Zhou Yiru works in the mind, but the difficult choices and secular pressures she faces are not what Zhang Wuji and other women do not have. Under the pressure of the extermination teacher in Wan&#39;an Temple, it is also the pressure of the teacher and the pressure of secular ethics. Next, succumb to the teacher&#39;s life. If she was young and Yang did not regret, and Zhang Wuji had such an emotional basis, she might make a different choice. Zhou Yiruo is a person who is obedient to traditional rituals. She was taught by the Emei School under the authority of a young man. It is not like the other four women and is separated from the traditional culture of the Central Plains by a safe distance. Therefore, she said that her martial arts skills are not as good as Zhao Min, marriage is to Xie Xun to take the lead, followed by Zhang Wuji also hope that he can be specific to himself, he can only be one death. She became like Zhao Min, Yin Li, and Yang did not regret the love and hate that was abandoned from the wedding in Zhangzhou. After such huge damage, I wanted to fight. The section of Shaolin Temple is the peak of Zhou Yuruoâ€™s unfortunate woman, and it is also a painful place for people to feel pity. At the Shaolin Temple Heroes Conference, when her nine-yellow white-claw claw caught Zhang Wuji&#39;s chest, she saw the scar on the top of the light she used to stab the sword, so she couldn&#39;t catch it. After the end of the contest, the nightZhang Wuji went to visit Zhou Ruoruo. The dialogue was like a person who was sad to the extreme. He dissected himself with a knife and wanted to let the person see the compassion of this love. &quot;I saw Zhou Yiru sitting on the side, squatting with his hand, and licking out the gods. He heard that he came in and didn&#39;t look back. The woman took a cup of tea and put it on the table. She then retired and gently took the door. Nothing else. A white candle flickers and flickers, according to Zhou Yiruo, a plain Tsing Yi, the scene is desolate. &quot;Zhang Wuji&#39;s heart is sour, whispered: &quot;What is the injury of Song Shige, wait for me to marry him.&quot; Zhou Yiruo still does not look back, cold and cold: &quot;His skull is shattered, the injury is extremely heavy, and most of them can&#39;t live. I don&#39;t know.&quot; Can&#39;t get through tonight.&quot; Zhang Wuji said: &quot;You know that my medical skills are not bad, I will try my best to help.&quot; Zhou Yiruo asked: &quot;Why are you saving him?&quot; Zhang Wuji said, &quot;I can&#39;t afford you, My heart is full of enthusiasm, not to mention the fact that you are merciless, and spared my life. Song brother is injured, I am doing my best.&quot; Zhou Yiruo said: &quot;You are in the first place, I don&#39;t know? If you can save Song Big Brother, ask me How to repay?&quot; &quot;Wu Zhou Ruodao said: &quot;You are not a god. I know that you will do your best to save him, so that you can do your own courtship to be a court horse.&quot; &quot;Zhou Yuruo sneered: &quot;We used to There is a marriage contract, my husband is dying at this moment, and today I did not hurt your life, others will say that I still have your old feelings. If you invite you to help, the heroes of the world must swear that I do not know shame, watery Yanghua. Zhang Avoid urgency: &quot;We only have to ask innocent, others speak, what do you care about?&quot; Zhou Yiruo said: &quot;If I ask what is wrong?&quot; Zhang Wuji stayed, could not pick up, only said: &quot;You ... you... ...&quot;&quot; The situation is so strong, and it is hard to let go of it. Later, after Zhao Min was in the bush, Zhou Yiru asked Zhang Wuji, Xiao Zhao, Zhao Min, Yin Li, and her four girls. Which one did he really love in his heart? Although it is not obsessive, it is not unwilling. Say goodbye and wait, and did not do so. Fortunately, Jin Yong gave Zhou Yiru a possibility. The sound of the pen falling on the table will surely reverberate in everyone&#39;s heart.",movie

In the end, many characters suddenly burst into tears at the end of the perfect ending. I admire the writing skills of the nine knives, and can write an earth-shattering momentum in the plain and unpretentious, and finally the scene of Yizhi flashes back and sees it.

518,"You think this is a story about the wolf, you are wrong, in fact, this is a story about the relationship between the wolf and the three women. You think this is a process of describing the relationship between three women and one man. You are wrong again. In fact, this is a landscape propaganda film describing Tokyo. You think this is a Tokyo landscape film. You are still wrong. In fact, this is just a road to reincarnation in Tokyo. From: On August 9, 1945, the United States under the head of Nagasaki, before the earth was devastated, the wolf rescued a Japanese officer, but the officer witnessed a miracle of energy. Turn: After N years, this officer has become the first super-rich man on the Forbes list in Japan, but he is already ill, and hopes to see his own great benefactor while he is still alive. Cheng: Icy temperament female, anime warrior, Russian long-legged sister, there is also a childhood sweetheart, these elements are enough for the wolf to drink a pot, the elements are already quite a lot, so bed play is inevitable. He: Uncle Wolf accepted the departure of love, and Professor Wan and King X reappeared in a timely manner. Wan Wang was just a mysterious smile in the crowd like Mona Lisa, so we began to look forward to the new song. Start and take. In the previous section, Wolves were entangled in the whole world, but this part of the role was concentrated on three women. The story was translated from the United States to the East, and by the way, the culture of the country of Dongpu was reflected. Reflecting the care of the Japanese younger brother, Hollywood also let the uncle Wolf lose his self-recovery talent in the film, and even abandoned his favorite woman on the pillow, just need a light belt, and immediately went to Wushan Yunyu to win There are countless people in the world. Well, the story of Uncle Wolf is called &quot;I fell in love with the granddaughter of my old friend&quot;, or &quot;Uncle Wolf, fall in love with me, you will die.&quot; The beginning of the film is a dream, so I have to exclaim that the continuous effect of &quot;Pirates of the Dream&quot; can be so long, losing the pain of love, let him have a dream of a night, when the camera scans to a rundown When itâ€™s a small nest, itâ€™s probably only the screaming radio that can prove a trace of life. Itâ€™s a bit like Iâ€™m going to work every time. The first thing I do when I get home is to turn on the TV first, as if the TV had become me. Talking people, so saying that loneliness is a cruel and unusual thing. If loneliness is a cruel thing, then it is only death that is more cruel than loneliness, so many people are demanding immortality. For example, as early as the Qin Dynasty, the First Emperor sent people to Dongdu to seek longevity cheats. I donâ€™t know if the country that Dongdu was at that time is nowJapan, anyway, Uncle Wolf&#39;s old friend wants to copy his strange qualities, but Uncle Wolf tells him that &quot;any mortal person should not betray the theory of life&quot;, so the tragedy is inevitably released. Once, that person was redeemed. Your body; now, that person has redeemed your soul. In fact, this is the first echo of the echo, but the writer has deviated the clues of the narrative far and wide, such as the dispensable people, and wants to prove that the wolf is not an uncle who has not annihilated humanity, and you have Describe the gang ganging incident, I thought that there would be any extra eggs to share, the result is not, even with the uncle&#39;s old friends, there is not much relationship, what is the rhythm? When the last big monster appeared, maybe many people and I have guessed that the mask will be an old friend who has saved his life and has passed away. If you donâ€™t tell the story, you canâ€™t justify it, and itâ€™s not like The current results are more educational in film. I just didnâ€™t expect the old friendâ€™s granddaughter, the truth, to have such a heart. Itâ€™s really a big chess in the next set, and itâ€™s a big knife. Itâ€™s good to let Grandpa die in his own hands. This is to tell us the result of being a self-restraint. ? Therefore, the name of the film can be called &quot;The Rose of Blood&quot;, but the blood dyed by the rose may kill the grandfather, or it may be left on the sheets with the wolf. If you must be demanding the story of the story, it would be better to appreciate the scene of this &quot;color and fragrance&quot; extra with the Tokyo adult action movie, but you can talk about the lack of the story. 3) When it comes to the island country, everyone has an island dream in their hearts. It can even be said that everyone has a dream of guiding the island nation. Don&#39;t think too much, I am talking about things like Lost in Tokyo, Tokyo Story, Tokyo Love Story, and so on. I said you want more. From the perspective of Hollywood, Tokyo is full of many oriental styles with Zhang Yimou and others. For the panoramic view of the Japanese courtyard built on the cliffs, the meticulously depicted samurai sword and armor, as well as Japan. Symbols of warriors, ninjas, etc., and of course the Shinkansen in Tokyo, a street in Kabukicho, seems to have been thrown into the movie without any order. The chaotic hodgepodge was rated as &quot;Japan-US film culture exchange&quot; in the eyes of fans, but in the eyes of critics, it can be described as &quot;four kinds of pure business guidance.&quot; However, in the colorful colors and the flood of the big close-up in the fighting scene, I noticed a scene, thatJust when I saw Wolverineâ€™s image of a ninja in the Japanese countryâ€™s snowy night, the memory of my heart seemed to have been passed through to the Song Dynasty, because one of the comic strips of Yue Fei Chuan, which I saw when I was young, said that Yang Zaixing The content that was mistakenly entered into Xiaoshanghe was shot by the arrow, but the Wolverine in the movie did not hang directly like Yang Zaixing. It seems that for the global box office guarantee, unscrupulously added &quot;Oriental elements&quot; to modify and demonstrate the relatively weak storyline, &quot;Wolverine 2&quot; is not the first film to use &quot;exotic style&quot; to save the sequel, such as before us The 007 series and the disc-and-spray series that have been chased by the audience? When the bridge of justice against evil is difficult to make new, changing the battle scene can really make the audience hooked. It seems that this is a common problem in Hollywood. Slowly learn to accept their marketing. If you look at the box office contributions of those Asian countries, you can see the whole leopard. In fact, the fight on the Shinkansen makes me feel like a cool running game where passengers on the subway are playing. If you add a link to eat gold coins, it is a new movie setting plot for the game, but this is not the case. In special cases, Jackie Chan has never played a street game of King of Fighters in a film. If you are an island state, then this good show must not be missed. I am not kidding. We all know that American movies are all lonely heroes, so we can watch the promo at once and see what the story is about, so the suspense set in the film is like a chicken rib. In front of the audience, the basics will become a useless gimmick. The ending is already doomed. It is useless to struggle with all kinds of villains. It is destined to fail in the final battle. It seems to be the case, but if you It is quite boring to think about it. In fact, the story is here. There are already movie good guys who are guessing whether the role of Wolverine will continue to be photographed like the previous 007. From the menu at the end of this section, at least the filming of &quot;Wolverine 3&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not a problem, but as far as the role of Hugh Jackman is concerned, if you want to shoot a sequel, I think his image may still be replaced by no one, just like Matt Damon.&quot; &quot;Overlaying&quot; &quot;A Tango&quot; in &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;. Perhaps the next story is not a chemical reaction with three women, or maybe the next time the scenery is not just Tokyo. In short, we are all lost in a call called Hugh JackmanThe wolf uncle man there.",movie
519,"Have you ever thought that your intolerance is the root of your life&#39;s pain? When you get married, your feelings will change. I have always felt that if a former partner is derailed, it can only be embarrassed and not saved. Since marriage is not for the sake of immortality, there must be a generosity that can tolerate a partner&#39;s derailment. Of course, there must be courage to be able to live independently from the partner. Without such generosity, he also reported that his husband was derailed. It was a pile of love that also ruined his family. If there were relatives who reported their loved ones, there are close relatives in the law. It is undeniable that the woman has received a lot of damage. But it is undeniable that this is more or less her own. A happy life is always related to reconciliation with oneself and reconciliation with others, not a house car ticket and a child. You see the woman every time I see my son, what is the job. The childâ€™s true goodness should be the focus of her concern, but she skipped it; you see the woman moving to a new home and being happy, never thinking about how a husband who lacks dignity inside and outside family life can make himself I will live a good life in my new home in the future; you see that the female owner has repeatedly mentioned that &quot;you can enjoy his son&#39;s blessing afterwards&quot;. She has always regarded her contribution and her son&#39;s success as a kind of production. Out, and her own true well-being (such as finding someone who loves herself and loves her in that decade) and her son&#39;s well-being (the simple family care that her son longed for) she ignored. All of this is an intolerance to oneself and the people around me: I often ask people around me how to live a good life, but refuse to accept mediocrity and simple happiness. Of course, I know that the main theme of this movie is not this. I just can&#39;t help but vomit and can&#39;t understand the woman like the woman. Her dedication, her tears, may touch you, but in my opinion, that self-pity will not reflect.",movie
520,"&quot;Uniform&quot; reminds me of the 2011 &quot;Watcher: Sin and Lost&quot;, perhaps also has both Ren Dahua and Chen Sicheng, both of which are talking about the theme of &quot;going to crimes between thoughts&quot;, and some aspects are very similar. Although the plots and shootings of the two are different, they are all immature. &quot;Sin of Lost&quot; is the beginning of mediocrity, and the latter is getting better. The &quot;uniform&quot; was not as good as expected at first, but it was reversed by the last ten minutes. And the horror of the corpse, the serial killing, the thrilling chase of the construction site, the flesh of the food factory, the ruin of childhood shadows, the violent robbery and other heavy taste elements, make &quot;uniform&quot; more like a Hong Kong 90s B-class film. A corpse dressed as a nurse surprised the abandoned hospital, a murderous murder case occurred one after another, a group of busy police officers, a lady who was targeted by the murderer Zhou Wei, plus the captain of Ren Dahua, Fang Youwei The wife has just left him........ These seemingly similar vigilant criminal bridges are placed in the era of &quot;The Silent Lamb&quot;, &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot; and &quot;Instinct&quot; in the last century. It is the most popular. However, in the new century of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, &quot;Eavesdropping&quot; and &quot;Crim War&quot; became the mainstream police film, &quot;Warning undercover&quot; has replaced &quot;serial perverted murderers&quot;, making this kind of film even more extinct. Hong Kong has abandoned the B-level police film of such violent pornography. The &quot;uniform&quot; can appear in the Mainland. I am afraid that it is inextricably linked with Wang Jing in the &quot;supervisor&quot; subtitle. However, as a small and medium-sized police film, &quot;uniform&quot; is relatively compact. For example, Ren Dahua played the old hot police detective, constantly conflicting with Yuan Hongâ€™s smashing police detective, and always leading the way, quite a general style. Wu Yan&#39;s perverted tailor, the big show orchids, the same actor in the construction site chasing melee, the two hit the fall, making people tremble. What about Chen Sicheng? At first, wearing glasses to sell insurance crazy, thinking that he is a gag, who knows that behind the fierce light, the smile does not laugh, incarnate as a metamorphosis total BOSS, so that the plot to the high end. In order to make a lot of mistakes, the film has made three criminal suspects, constantly confusing the audience with the fake murderer. The final result is only a little unexpected, and can not completely brew a detective masterpiece. However, Wang Guangliâ€™s directorâ€™s baggage was quite interesting, and many of the details of the front and back of the details were still a bit of a thought. For example, Gao Qunâ€™s directorâ€™s black-hearted butcher who sells dead pigs is guilty of confession but is mistaken as a murderer. This kind of black humor makes people feel awkward; like Xu Ruo? When he sees Ren Dahua, he protects the manners of cultural relics, she and other ladies. People quarrel and receive special postal parcels.There is a one-to-one correspondence between the pen and the back, so the shocking reversal at the end is very reasonable.

The total BOSS was mischievous because of the rich female classmates in childhood, and the bare butt fell into the cold water, causing the loss of sexual function. It was also expelled from the school, and it was also full of incredible bizarre. The buddy forced Ren Dahua to sing &quot;praise me&quot;.

Robert Rodriguez made the series of &quot;Machete&quot;, which seems to be the other way to fill the end of the &quot;Guitar Prodigal El Marach&quot; trilogy. As soon as he entered the line, Laguna began to produce a series of &quot;Mexican Ranger Legends&quot;, eager to create the heroes of the US-born Wu Yusen and the Italian Western, &quot;The Killer&quot;, &quot;The Dawn&quot;, &quot;The Desperate&quot;, &quot;Mexico&#39;s Past&quot;, the same pigeon church, the fire of the guns and the ranger&#39;s squad, but more of the chic of the Mexican guitar, not only that, Ronaldinho also added a considerable number of clues, suggesting that these films Under the same world view, for example, &quot;Machete&quot; has a musical theme similar to &quot;El Marach&quot;, and the classic &quot;shotgun&quot; has appeared in &quot;Slaying a Dawn&quot; in Tom Savigny. His Majesty, &quot;The Desperate&quot; in Antonio Banderas&#39;s guitar case and this latest &quot;Machete Killing&quot; in the sire of Sophia Vigara, like fans crazy discussion Quentin &quot;water dog&quot; Michael Madsen and John Travolta in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; are not brothers, and Laguna also makes these &quot;rough and inferior&quot; films have a fine place. &quot;Machete Killing&quot; continues the stance of deliberately inferior mixing. It is not as simple as a series of children&#39;s movies like Laguna. It can be done with false special effects, but it is not like sin. The city is so pure to take the style to fight, its funIt is a strong &quot;adult fairy tale&quot; color: a Mexican version of James Bond has grown so freely, and it is directly different from the previous Mexican version of the giant darts Antonio Banderas, and it is such a stupid call. The guy of his own name, there are countless beautiful women dumping it, and with a machete, it seems that it can only be attributed to the various lower limits of Cult&#39;s bad taste. Take this episode &quot;Machete Killing&quot;, just in the last episode led a scimitar of the border mob anti-government revolution, this episode was immediately summoned by the US president to save the world, even more ridiculous, by private life The promiscuous Charlie Sheenâ€™s role as a president is like a former male, so there is no serious American theme and artificial heroism. The movie is a real Bonnie rabbit cartoon, just Bonnie Rabbit likes to tease the hunter Mr. Aifa with all kinds of nonsense and bloodless pranks, and &quot;Machete Killing&quot; shoots the bloody side of these mischiefs. At the beginning of the movie, I spoof the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, and let the little plums and Justin Bieber both lay their guns. This third episode of the fake trailer can be said to be the best-looking paragraph of the whole movie, and then the whole film. It was trapped in complete chaos. Compared with the first episode, the story of the second episode has gone beyond the so-called spoof and playfulness in the B-level narrative. The drag of the wind makes the evil taste completely replace the story, but the fragmentation of the film structure and the childishness make the style appeal. Also ended in failure. Itâ€™s hard to describe what the story of &quot;Machete Killing&quot; is. There are latent Latin agents who are constantly splitting between the rebel leader and the war madman. There is a US president who sleeps three sisters and legalizes cannabis cultivation. There are prostitutes who work part-time as mercenaries, as well as bounty killers who have a few fake faces and ambitions who are keen on cloning the army and space roaming. The film begins in the conflict between the scimitar and these people. And the end, there is no sense and logic at all, and there is also a section of the enthusiasm of 3D technology by the enthusiasm of Denett Joe and Ameberhild. This paragraph seems to be joyful, but in fact makes the whole film less tune. Although I smiled from the beginning to the end when I was watching the movie with my friends, it was more because of the deliberate ugliness of the &quot;curve knife killing&quot;, rather than the fun of the former episode and even the &quot;Criminal House&quot;. La Wind has retained most of the team&#39;s &quot;Machete&quot;, but it is not flattering. Jessica Alba&#39;s soy sauce repeats &quot;MerseyIn the past, Banderasâ€™s flashback bridge section about his wifeâ€™s murder, but this time the beauty is next to Dennett Joe, only the wrath of anger. The female man Michel Rodriguez is still tough this time, but at the end he is once again in line with Depp Uncle in &quot;The Mexican Past&quot;, his eyes are all under the jurisdiction, the combat power is not falling, and he accepts it silently. The most intolerable is Tom Savigny, who had a cool show in the last time. The murderer who used to wash the church turned into a wretched outcrop in this episode, and the contrast of 180 degrees before and after was revealed. La Feng Luo does not cherish and squander the role, this kind of foolish creative attitude is also the main reason for the fiasco of &quot;Machete Killing&quot;. As for the newly added Lady GaGa, Banderas and Gooding who came to help the field, these three big cards actually played a role. The taste of &quot;Forcing guest eyeballs&quot; was too strong. Fortunately, the performance of the three people was very pleasing. Especially GaGa, I didn&#39;t expect to play such a naughty horse. As Mel Gibson&#39;s brain powder, this can only be said to be unsatisfactory. The presence of this big villain is not as strong as that of the clones he created. Gibson is not Siegel, so the appreciation of this set of samurai swords and choppers is Big discounts, but the end is a bright spot. I always feel that the fake trailers that had been spoofed in &quot;Star Wars&quot; are still unfinished. The result is indeed the same. In the end, Mel Gibson incarnates the Mexican style of Darth Vader and will be Michelle Rodriguez. In the Empire Strikes Back, Harrison Ford has also become a human amber, brought to space, paving the way for the third episode of life and death, but with the machete created after the concept and ideas of the trilogy Killing, everything seems to be very rushing, like a trailer that was hurriedly made for &quot;space killing again&quot;. All the characters and plots give people a sense of rush. It can be said that this time the most appropriate setting of the whole film tone, in my opinion, only the uncle Charlie She and GaGa sister and the fake trailer. In recent years, La Wind has not been good at the box office or in the word of mouth. Looking at the good friend Quentin is gradually getting better and better, I donâ€™t know what I think, here, I still hope that the stupidity in &quot;Machete Killing&quot; And casually because of its parody of B-level films, do not deliberately do not really make mistakes and mistakes caused by lack of skills, at least not to see in the next year&#39;s &quot;Sin City 2&quot; .",movie
522,"In the last years of the Ming Dynasty, there were internal and external problems. On the one hand, the people of Limin suffered from the famine, and on the other hand, the war was a disaster, and the misfortune of history provided a lot of excellent materials for film creation. It is unceremonious to say that the historical material mastered by &quot;Da Ming Bao&quot; is not inferior to Liu Zhenyun&#39;s creation and Feng Xiaogang&#39;s &quot;1942&quot;. The former is a plague, the latter is a famine. The former is a government army against Li Zicheng, and the latter is a government army against Japanese soldiers. Although there are certain gaps in the investment cost of the two films, apart from the visual effects presented by the film and television content, if you look at the script alone, you will find that the &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot; and &quot;1942&quot; are &quot;missing&quot; in their skill. A thousand miles difference.&quot; &quot;1942&quot; was cut from the perspective of a hungry people. The whole process was recorded by the eyes of the poor. Although it was in the multi-line advancement, it also pointed out the trade-offs and choices of many high-powered people such as Chiang Kai-shek and Henan Governor in the face of famine. The main line is the bottom layer, it is a disaster, and it is a reflection on why China has always been devastated by disasters. This is a kind of writer&#39;s feelings by the author Liu Zhenyun. This kind of sentiment is not something that ordinary novels can possess. The perspective of &quot;Da Ming Bao&quot; is similar to the general history of the book, such as &quot;Those Things in the Ming Dynasty&quot;, and looks at the problem from a perspective of power. In other words, it is called the global perspective, the overall perspective. The main line of the film is how a general who is on the verge of death is preparing for the levy. The auxiliary line is a doctor practicing medicine. The film is considered to be a smart place, or it may be in its overall perspective, the overall situation is important, but in terms of art, this is the failure. Especially on the eve of the general&#39;s expedition, arson killed hundreds of infected plague soldiers for the best representative of the overall perspective. Although there was a mourning from the doctors in the film, it ended in the general situation of the general. To put it bluntly, the editorial of the film is self-righteous and stands at a certain historical level, finding an excuse for the death of a few living individuals. It is very important that the writer writes his own height of the station and responds to the script creation. Excellent novels and scripts should have a global awareness, but remember that you cannot have the right to be conscious. &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot; is actually standing on the perspective of a powerful, to explain the &quot;small murder&quot;, and this interpretation eventually ended in a grandiose mood. The writer Xie Xiaodong lacks the underlying feelings and always takes the emperor&#39;s thinking. This mode of thinking directly hampers his work to a higher level. Rather than saying that &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot; is talking about national disasters, it is better to say that it is about emperor and generals. How does a general have pressure on the emperor to rush out?Under the circumstances that there are not enough soldiers and plagues, the levy is prepared. He prepares for this war with his &quot;Generals&quot;. Chinese historical officials are good at documenting such emperors and generals. Including many people who write a history in the moment, there is no such thing as &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;. Xie Xiaodong, a well-known scriptwriter, obviously did not escape the logical thinking of the gang who wrote history, and thought that Gaomingâ€™s step-by-step work would be done. Writing history is just a question of writing these &quot;surgery&quot;, but writing a screenplay, especially a film work that exists as a work of art, with &quot;skills&quot; as the core, is obviously inferior. The writer has no ability to reverse his own perspective, let alone talk about rebuilding a bottom-down perspective of the late Ming Dynasty. Because of this powerful perspective, the film has no thought-provoking conflicts at all. From the perspective of power and wealth, it is okay to kill people in a small situation for the sake of justice. Therefore, after the generals murdered, the writer did not raise a huge compassionate feeling. On the contrary, he wisely explained the murder. Therefore, when we look at the &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot;, there is obviously a feeling of being screened and directed by the director to instill a sense of power and a sense of generality. With this kind of consciousness, it is difficult to see all the contradictions created by the plot, and it is difficult to go deep into the contradiction. It can only be accompanied by the writer and the director. Because of this perspective, there is no original creation of &quot;Da Mingruo&quot;. The plague of the Ming army, the lack of food, and the inability to fight... These things that have been recorded in history have been treated with a simple visualization. What is profound? Why is it not profound? Because the perspective of power has obliterated all contradictions and conflicts. Therefore, it is inevitable to touch on the existence value of the movie &quot;Da Ming Rob&quot;. If &quot;1942&quot; with a similar background is the moment of the earthquake, alert us that in the new era, if the disasters in the movie can no longer be caused by the imbalance, what does &quot;Da Mingruo&quot; tell us? ?? It is undoubtedly telling us that killing the SARS soldiers is taking care of the overall situation. Art, first of all, does not talk about the overall concept. Only the art of power and manipulation is the only way to talk about the big picture. &quot;1942&quot; ended with a tough life, but it was desolate but had life. &quot;How is the Da Ming robbery&quot; how to practice the doctor, so doing sublimation is really powerless and artificial. Some works are worth comparing. With a simple display of the sense of power and loyalty, it is not a realistic, true, and straightforward banner that can be used to whitewash its low level of artistic quality.

One is aging, the other is aging, and the accident is divided into many kinds, such as diseases, car accidents, wars, explosions, homicides, etc. Knowing which day you will disappear on this earth without warning, the world still maintains its balance of rotation. The owner of the book, Eddie, died in a spinning wheel in order to save a little girl. If there is no tomorrow, if you have a sense of crisis, if you know the last time of your life, you will pay attention to the only remaining time on this earth, do what you like, make things that make you feel meaningful, or change your perspective. Try to discover the value of what you are doing. I go to sleep every night and I open my eyes every morning. Is there anything better than this?

525,"Seeing &quot;The Enemy&quot; is easy to think of two other masterpieces. One is the &quot;People&#39;s Witness&quot;, which was praised at the box office of the previous period. The discussion of humanity, which is also a crime, hatred, redemption and forgiveness, is inextricably linked with the real society. Wan Hao&#39;s connection, and also adopted an unconventional multi-line spread in the narrative technique; the other is the super classic Martin Scorsese&#39;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, Wu Zhenyu&#39;s human conflict in the film Jin and De Niro were very similar to the characterization of an ordinary figure. And the film also has super nervous and intense sensory effects on the screen, audio-visual and emotional impact! As a city crime film, &quot;The Enemy&quot; expresses the extremes of the bustling and darkness of the modern city, and it also portrays the extraordinary fate of ordinary people in the city. In the eyes of the public, the city of Xiamen should belong to the prosperous and romantic city. And when it was injected into the elements of rivers and lakes and crime, it was mostly sinister and chilly. The slashing, raping, tracing, shooting, and returning to the scenes, such as those that have been active in Hong Kong classic police films and gangsters, have also slammed the audience&#39;s attention in the cities of the interior. Those gangs who seem ordinary on weekdays can&#39;t seem to be so helpless and wrong in the ordinary drivers, shopkeepers, and younger brothers who are in the process of killing and revenge. Under the hands of the best photographer of the 9th Hong Kong Film Awards and Hong Kong&#39;s ace photographer Huang Yuetai, the film&#39;s color and shooting angle are very particular. The overall feeling is the taste of Hong Kong film; Big Brother and younger brother The perverted hate state of style, mental disorder and inner collapse, after the wonderful performances of Hong Kong movie stars such as Wu Zhenyu, Lin Xue and Fan Shaohuang, immerse you in the world of Hong Kong police films all the time. The film is unique and creative in its narrative structure. At the beginning, the fragmentation process was used to extract all the lines and lines in the story for propositional placement, giving the audience a sense of fear and curiosity in high-speed screen switching and intense soundtrack. Everyone will wonder why the bloody and cruel plots in the picture, why is this happening, what happened in the picture, what is the unbearable thing about the prisoner and the taxi driver? The director&#39;s screenwriter uses the public&#39;s curiosity and the persistence of finding the truth to lead the audience into the play. In the following expansion process, the complex history of the two protagonists will be presented in a relatively soothing relationship and love scene.The puzzles that began at the beginning also gradually unveiled the truth. Wu Zhenyu played Yang Yan, who violated the law and justice. However, after losing her daughter and wife, she only gave the murderer a three-year jail sentence. The unwillingness and dissatisfaction caused him to lose his sense of madness. The vows have ruined the once-famous writer for years. We can see that this scene will not help but be pity for him, pity, and sad for such a society, so when he wants to personally punish the actions of the gangsters who ruined his family, we did not think how abominable he is. And hateful, I always take it for granted, and I need to do that to untie the unity in my heart. Contrary to this, Zhang Jin, played by Fan Shaohuang, used to be the scapegoat for the tragedy. The three-year prison sentence made him understand the principle of human forgiveness. Zhang Jinâ€™s self-salvation and forgiveness journey after he was released from prison gave a lot of threats and made the great father and the great husbandâ€™s dark minds change. Although there was a moment of sorrow and anger, there was a very bright ending in the end, without producing particularly tragic and dark consequences. This is the need of the theme of the film, and it is also the need to express the greatness of human nature and justice in the black story. Hatred can destroy everything that is good, only to eliminate hatred and rationality, and to face and deal with it with a kind of forgiveness. Be aware that those who are sinful will always get karma.",movie

If they have goals, it is undoubtedly a society in which everyone is equal and there is no difference.

527,"A person who is self-sufficient, if he still has a gentle face, he can go to be a moral model, and the writer&#39;s business is probably not suitable for him. I have been in the literary circle for more than ten years. The writers I have seen say that thousands of people are absolutely exaggerated. To say hundreds of things should be regarded as seeking truth from facts. Like the king, I am so honest, I saw it for the first time. The first time I saw him was in a mediocre wine bureau, everyone was drinking, eating, and talking about dispensable gossip. The day before I participated in this wine bureau, I drank too much?? Itâ€™s a shame, I drink too much. The king couldn&#39;t sit next to me, or next door next door, and he didn&#39;t talk much all night. The classmates of the organizing bureau introduced that the king could not write and also wrote things. He nodded gently, and he said hello. Later, we met again. He sent me a book and said that if you have time to turn over, you are practicing the pen. There is nothing to look at. Since he said so, I also believed. Why do I have to go to see a middle school teacher&#39;s practice? Zhongshan is so small, there are so many people writing, everyone knows the truth, and I am an active person. In my reading range, this name is very strange. The next thing is a bit of a clichÃ©, or let&#39;s take an analogy. The literary world is like a river and lake. China is a big river and a lake. Zhongshan is a small river and lake. The rivers and lakes must have the rules of the rivers and lakes. Those who have a famous name are familiar with each other. Some words are not so good, and he is still small, on the rivers and lakes. It is also a descendant of unknown people, and some words are enough to say. That day, I drank some wine?? Drinking again, I hate myself?? He said something, nothing more than gossip, he looked down and listened, from time to time to pick up a sentence or two, it is nothing more than entertainment. sentence. Yes, what is my relationship with him? Nothing is even, even friends are not. At noon, I found a place to rest, sleep can not sleep, TV has nothing to look at, then, read a book! At the noon that was so boring, I remembered the name and his words. There are always some high-ranking people on the rivers and lakes, and the king is definitely one of them. He doesn&#39;t talk, doesn&#39;t sell, even when I call him, saying that I like his words, his tone is still flat, light like the sky washed by the rain. I am ashamed of my narrowness, remembering the words I said to him, I think I am like a clown. In an era when everything is accelerating, the wheat is yellower, the girls are already 15 years old, and the pigs can be sold for a few months. Literature has taken the opposite path.The two precious words of &quot;genius&quot; are cheaper like the love in a hotel and can&#39;t be hit. I am more and more convinced that today&#39;s literature is late, and the growth of a writer has become longer and longer because of the accelerated development of the times. The reason is very simple: an era of accelerated development is bound to be complex, and it takes time to master these complex experiences. A premature writer can win a slap in the face of one or two sentences, and he can also gain the benefits of the present world. But obviously, there is no place in the coordinates of literature. Let&#39;s go back and look at the 80 generations that have been ripened. Where have they gone? 10 years have passed, what have they left behind? From this perspective, it is not too late for Wang to play today, but it is still too early. In his words?? &quot;I think I still need ten years to practice.&quot; Being able to calm down is obviously a virtue, although this virtue has been forgotten by too many people. He Yong sang in the &quot;Junkyard&quot; that &quot;the world we live in is like a junkyard / people are like bugs / here you fight for me to grab / eat are conscience / pull all thinking.&quot; So, can we not make a bug? If the world is really a junkyard, what is the best thing to grab? Gossip about it, itâ€™s time to talk about business. Readers who read this article must have read &quot;Broken Mirror&quot; and &quot;I am colder than summer.&quot; how does it feel? Do you like it? If you don&#39;t like it, it doesn&#39;t matter, you have this right. If you like it, that&#39;s fine too. But I have to tell you that for the two articles, I prefer the &quot;broken mirror&quot;. A writer who doesn&#39;t remember the name said that all the writer&#39;s creations are derived from his childhood experience. To explain this, this is not to say that a writer&#39;s lifelong writing is a copy of childhood experience, which is obviously ridiculous. Rather, a writer&#39;s way of thinking, the world view has been formed in childhood, and then growth is just a process of continuous enrichment. In fact, not only the world view, the tone of a writer, but also the way of narrative has been formed. What we can change is only the expression of language, and the inner tone is like a fingerprint. It is unique and unchangeable. We identify the way a writer is. A good writer can present his characteristics in a complete way, thus forming his unique temperament and distinguishing him from the people around him. &quot;Broken Mirror&quot; presents a complete and direct childhood experience of the King, his tone is still there, but those childhoodsThe experience has been forgotten by too many people, or deliberately buried, we even lack the courage to show it. Neil Bozman wrote in &quot;The Escape of Childhood&quot; that &quot;the hide-and-seek that has appeared in Athens during the reign of Pericles more than two thousand years ago has almost completely disappeared from children&#39;s spontaneous entertainment. Children&#39;s games, in a nutshell, have become extinct species. He also said that &quot;there is no highly developed shame, and childhood cannot exist.&quot; In these two paragraphs, I have said two questions. The first is the importance of childhood games to the growth of a person. Another is that childhood is a crucial period in the formation of a world outlook. In The Broken Mirror, we can vividly see the existence of childhood activities, and one&#39;s shame is gradually formed in childhood activities. Look at this person&#39;s childhood, how healthy it should be. To be honest, the child I saw in Broken Mirror, and the king I saw now, are not quite like a person. Or, they change too much, and I can&#39;t recognize it. A child with a healthy childhood, even if he is embarrassed by the years, has a gentle face, and even if the wildness is gradually worn away, his heart should remain original shame. Fortunately, this shame is still there in the king. He always said that he read too little, read too shallowly, and the article was written too badly. Even if there is self-importance in it, you can see his demands on his heart, which is always good. In this kind of self-improvement, there is actually a ubiquitous self-confidence. He believes that time is still long, he still has enough time to solve these problems, and now he does not have to worry. I don&#39;t know what the fragmented writing of Broken Mirror means to the King. Just from the title, he obviously realizes that he is recording pieces of memory that he is trying to refract through. The light illuminates his childhood, it is not three-dimensional, but multifaceted and true. The words that the king can&#39;t remember are clean, concise, and elegant, which is rare. I have seen too many impatience, busy words, and his silence seems so different. In my opinion, his text has a strong taste of Ming and Qing essays, and you can also see the traces of &quot;Shi Shuo Xin Yu&quot;, which is probably related to his career. As a middle school language teacher, he has to contact these. I like the sense of humor and joy that permeates these fragments. When a person recalls his childhood, he is not sad or sad. This is somewhat surprising. Because usually, the childhood we saw is like this, hard and hard, full ofThe tone of gray, an adult recalls the bleak childhood to prove that today&#39;s achievements are not occasional. In my opinion, this description of childhood has misunderstood childhood, he is scanning the past with the eyes of adults, that kind of bones The arrogance that comes out is self-satisfied. Others have gone to the other extreme, writing their childhood in a dust-free, purely like a cup of boiled water, which is not true and lacks the temperature of the human body. I remember reading a copy of Jiang Fangzhouâ€™s essay &quot;Trial of Childhood&quot;. That article is also my favorite. The &quot;broken mirror&quot; and &quot;trial for trial&quot; that are not king are inconsistent in temperament, and there is not much comparability. The similarities of themes, but they together convey the different experiences of childhood, this is enough. In fact, it is also true to read &quot;Broken Mirror&quot; as a novel. At least when I first read it, I thought it was a novel, and it was a good novel. The characters in him were all established and sensible. Why are the boundaries between novels and prose so clear? Some time ago, I went to Liujiaxia, where the Yellow River was as clear as a mirror, and the blue was like the sky, not the yellow we imagined. Even the water of the Yellow River can be so innocent, what else is so absolute? I was deeply touched by the sugar when I read the clip of my father riding the car with &quot;I&quot; to the machine factory. In fact, after reading &quot;Broken Mirror&quot;, you can&#39;t see a few &quot;love&quot; words, but if you don&#39;t feel love, then I can only say that there is no warm part in your blood, flowing in your blood vessels. All are hail. What I want to say is that no matter how the world changes, our pursuit of love will never decrease, only more, the reason why love becomes extravagant, just because we pretend to have forgotten it, pretending that we can not rely on love. Alive. The king can&#39;t tell the reader frankly in The Broken Mirror, I love, and I still need love. Love is actually not that complicated, it exists naturally, as long as you are willing to feel it. &quot;I am colder than the summer&quot; continues the style of &quot;broken mirror&quot; in the language, and his tone is still there. From this novel, it is not difficult to see that the king can&#39;t work hard on the text. From a formal point of view, this novel has some text features of the pioneer novel. If you go deeper, you will find that this is obviously not the temperament of the king. He is just a good imitator. He has adopted some technical strategies to bury his true self. I think he probably doesn&#39;t want to tell a simple story, nor is he willing to be a vulgar storyteller. A novel can have a story, but the story is absolutely notIt is a novel. Any style has its intrinsic characteristics, and form is absolutely necessary for art. Some subsections of this novel may have been noticed. From &quot;zero&quot; to &quot;five&quot;, this is a beautiful little trick. Let&#39;s reveal the answer here, save the readers to guess, these numbers are actually the first person. My narrative age. Well, it is easy to see that the novel that Wang canâ€™t be is still fragmentary. He intercepted the memories of the time between the ages of fifteen and twenty. Throughout the novel, there are only the emotions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;I&quot;. Other characters appearing are just a dispensable shadow. It is for this reason that after reading this novel, you may remember &quot;I&quot;. But other memories are very weak. Of course, this can also be a novel. The pioneering literature is popular, so much more. From the author&#39;s point of view, I don&#39;t want the king to keep doing this. It seems too clever and light, and the novel should have more solid things. Living in Zhongshan, I certainly know that he still lacks the basic training of novels, but I still have to say that if we are destined to be in the same language, then from the beginning, there can be no shallow heart, we must have some clumsy spirit. The 1984 king is still very young. Looking at his article, I often think of my twenty-seven years old. What am I doing? What am I thinking? I am not sure about anything else. What I can be sure of is that I don&#39;t have such good words as him, and I don&#39;t have such a good reading. At that time, I was young and frivolous, and there was no one in my eyes. In front of him, I often feel nervous and feel that he is oppressing me. I don&#39;t want to have one day, we are sitting together, and he has nothing to say to me. There is no fairer referee than time. One day, the stay will definitely stay, and some clouds will let it go. I also know that even if it is left for a while, it will become a cloud of smoke one day. If you continue to say this, you will fall into nothingness. Life must have some solid things to support us, such as faith. For us, words are our beliefs, which make our hearts clean and powerful. On the road of literature, we are all just beginning. To go on, talent alone is not enough. We have to be stubborn and firm. As a talented young man, the king has already let us see his talent. The next thing depends on himself. Of course he has the right to give up and treat all of this as a young dream, but as a peer, I hope he can persist, mature, and tell the world with his own works.Bound, I have a dream, it can come true.",movie

Lost In Panic Cruise (2011) Lost In Panic Cruise (2011) is a domestic suspense thriller, which is rare, so it is finished after downloading. The film tells about two perfectly designed murders. One day, the actor was invited by his friends to attend his luxury wedding, so the actor took his partner to bring the wedding to a lively cruise. After the male protagonist saw the friend bride and her three friends, he discovered that the bride was originally a primary school classmate. In the evening, a masquerade was held on the boat, and the people on the boat had a good time, but the cake prepared for the newlyweds was cut off and the chef had to mend the redo. After the dance, a bride&#39;s girlfriend was murdered with poisonous conch, and everyone suddenly became very panicked and suspicion. One of the women was the most suspected, and she had to pretend to have a heart attack and relapsed back into the house. A few hours later, the most suspected woman died of a heart attack. The male protagonist vaguely saw the murderer and began to track, but when he was traced, he was pushed down the boat and almost fell into the sea. After the hero was rescued, he began to analyze the truth, making the murderer confessed. The original murderer was the bride. The bride confessed that she wanted to kill the two because she didn&#39;t want her life to be exposed by the reports of the two, and she admitted that she had taken the second woman&#39;s heart medicine. In this way, the bride is taken care of by the male partner&#39;s work partner. After a while, the cruise ship hit the rocks and will sink to the bottom of the sea. Everyone fled. The actor allowed the groom to dive with himself to find the bride who escaped. But when the two men surfaced, they began to confront each other. The original male actor found the truth behind the truth, that is, the real murderer. The original groom is a test-tube baby. In order to conceal the truth, his rich dad does not doubt himself. He wants to kill two friends who can expose his life. The investigation of the two of them will expose their own life because of the creation of the groom. A person is one of the two mothers of the bride. Therefore, the actor&#39;s friend designed to let the bride kill, but the first dead woman was the actor&#39;s friend, and the cake was cut by him.Get it. The second womanâ€™s death was not because there was no medicine, but the groom released the poison gas. The male lead friend knows that the bride and the male protagonist know each other, so he is invited to board the ship. The purpose is to let the male lead expose the bride so that he can be offended. In addition, the cruise ship hit the rocks is also caused by the groom. In this way, the actor and the groom launched a big battle in the water, and finally the actor won. After all, the bride told the actor that she was also a test-tube baby, and she personally caused the death of her other mother. This movie is one of the few horror thrillers in China, so I am not expecting it, which makes the movie a big surprise for me. Because the film satisfies the basic requirements of a suspense thriller: the twists and turns of the story, the complex plot, the livelihood of the dialogue, the modern setting, the real character, and the guessing of the story and the plot. Therefore, I can&#39;t believe this is a domestic movie after reading it! How can it be shot so well? Can you still be &quot;harmonized&quot;? But the fact is that the film was indeed taken, and it brought me joy and joy. I won&#39;t repeat the film&#39;s plot. It&#39;s just a little bit complicated, and people who watch more movies can understand it. Itâ€™s just that this film is so beautiful and the script that needs to be thought out can be photographed without loopholes and flaws, which makes me too surprised! And homosexuality, test-tube babies, scams, betrayal, poisoning, murder, etc. These bridges that used to appear in ancient movies only in ancient times or are unlikely to appear in a modern movie are too amazing. ! Therefore, this movie made me feel that the domestic film is improving for the first time: I can also shoot some &quot;dark&quot; movies in China, and the SARFT also understands that it is loose. The objective of film shooting is quite reasonable, but it is already excellent for a domestic thriller. The film has luxurious scenery, beautiful costumes, competent actors, realistic reefs and escape shots, exquisite details, gorgeous editing, soundtracks for the scene, and the rare appearance of &quot;exposed meat&quot; in domestic films. These make the film not second only to the low-cost horror film with foreign countries. It can be seen that as long as the Chinese seriously film, they can still produce films that conform to modern aesthetics. In addition, I would like to talk about the &quot;skin&quot; of this film, because this is rare in domestic films. In fact, the &quot;skin&quot; is clearly revealed in the film. At the beginning of the film, the two women showed a proud &quot;chest&quot;. Isn&#39;t this obvious? What&#39;s more, in the middle of the movie, is there a more explicit open-back bathing show? Therefore, the film relies on beauty and bare film, which inevitably attracts bigThe audience, this is the magic weapon of the movie! No matter what other people, at least I was attracted. In short, this film satisfies the various tastes of the audience? It can look at the beauty and develop intelligence. This is a good movie! Finally, say two more words. First, the film has no feeling of film film, probably HD digital shooting. In fact, it is a pity that beauty should be filmed! Second, the little friend next to the actor is too powerful, and the lines are straightforward. It is he who makes the film have a gas, and it seems so real. Good actor, good script. The film&#39;s performance is ordinary, but women are very eye-catching. The male protagonists did not say, Su Youpeng and Yang Kun were flat, and I did not pay attention to them. The women in the film are the highlights. Zhou Weizhen, Wu Chenjun, and Ni Hongjie are all beautiful women, and they are all good and eye-catching. Especially Zhou Weijun, good body, good face, good chest, a standard beauty, and she still has acting skills, such Chinese actresses are rare. As for the rest of the film, itâ€™s all about the dragon. in conclusion. A domestically produced thriller that looks good and doesn&#39;t have too many loopholes, and the beauty is best used, it is worth collecting. Lost.In.Panic.Cruise.2011.720p.HDTV.x264-NGB",movie

I feel that my childhood is definitely a lot of love, from photos, memories, and dictation from others. But I don&#39;t know why, when I recall my childhood, I always remember the harshness of my parents and the boring suppression of my studies.

There is a kind of pleasure in the world that does not have to learn mathematics from the university. I really appreciate the strength and courage of Li Lanni. But her tough neighbors probably won&#39;t learn, because she was born in childhood, engraved in the growing bones.

This is also a nonsense, you lose everything, and of course you are free to do anything. This precondition has already left you untouched, and of course you can easily do FREE. The highest state of Free is: It has nothing to do with how many things you already have. It is free. Losing everything is just a more advanced excuse.

If you want a classic story, you don&#39;t have to be complicated. At present, many movies are like this, and it seems that the audienceâ€™s head is dizzy and succeeded. The audience was confused, and they forgot when they came out of the cinema. Donâ€™t forget, itâ€™s a mess in your mess. So people will forget a lot of movies selectively.

534,"I found that no matter what movie or TV series I watched, I should not try to watch the mainland&#39;s film reviews. I just saw the director and the actors&#39; self-reports and found that they often used a very positive and creative attitude to discuss various roles and conflicts. Even for the character of the character, it is not a one-sided, camp-style moral trial. I like this movie because I like to see the scriptwriter&#39;s design that is reasonable and clever for all kinds of characters. They are very complicated and many facets are also very real. This is a great story. The structure is cleverly set. Laobai is a person with a high level of intellectuals and a silky suffocation. The narrow ideological realm of ordinary people and the IQ above ordinary people have caused his life tragedy. He and his wife Skyler are both conservatives. The right and wrong are very strong. In other words, their right and wrong are completely consistent with mainstream morality. That is, illegal is wrong, and legal is right. But as the main force of earning money at home, in the face of more complicated actual situations and old-fashioned people with higher IQ, after all, it will not be as idealistic as Skyler? It is obvious that idealists are difficult to mix in society. This is the case with skyler and her sister. An insufficient idealist is terrible. The more he thinks he is the embodiment of justice, the stronger his desire to control. Why is Laobai unwilling to accept donations and embark on the road of crime? It has a lot to do with his lack of respect for his family. Old and white can&#39;t get the respect of students, and he is always in a weak position at home, but his ideological realm is not enough to make him realize the problem, but he is willing to be controlled by skyler&#39;s blackmail and morality. In the long run, it is naturally suppressed and it is urgent to export. He began to make drugs. In addition to the purpose of giving the family a sum of money, it is also an extremely important factor to live for himself when life is dying. It is a pity that the formation of a world view is hard to change. Laobai tried to save self-esteem in front of his family through money, and eventually he died. The only thing he did was to leave the family with a material wealth, but did not receive any gratitude and respect from them. From another perspective, the ordinary life revealed by this drama is actually very sad. Why does Laobai always emphasize for the family? Because in addition to this, he no longer has any motivation to support life. Why did the small powder collapse again and again? Because his spirit is more empty. If there is no religion, you have to have a little other belief. In short, they canâ€™t establish independent and free personal values, which is also in line with the American middle class.Case. Lawyers are not the same as this group of people. Therefore, he wants to be more free and chic. His last tragedy can be described as a situation that is not forced by the old white, old white wife, wife and sister. The protagonists in the play are selfish; especially the old white family, everyone tries to manipulate others. Laobai and his wife are not so much a love-based relationship between friends and relatives, but rather a relationship based on biological reproduction and economic interests. There is competition and cooperation. At the last moment, Skyler and their sons were completely untrustworthy to the old white, and they were all unreasonable. The logical reasoning was also in line with real life. I believe that the writer does not intend to have any criticism or irony, but as far as an outsider is concerned, this claim emphasizes the family&#39;s concept and tries to maintain this contradictory pair of demands in a conservative way. The American morality in the framework of the legal system is somewhat embarrassing and helpless. Small powder is the only one who is the most unselfish person. He is a person abandoned by middle-class families and has no set of values. He always has innocence, in other words, it is naive enough. Laobai is also a person with a sincere heart, but no matter how much inner struggle, Laobai will eventually use reason to choose a more practical way to better meet his own practical interests. The fundamental difference between Jesse and others is that he always acts instinctively, can&#39;t accept it, and can&#39;t accept it. He couldn&#39;t reconcile his emotions with reason, and he had to collapse again and again. His anger against Laobai is completely understandable, because his step-by-step approach to drug trafficking is indeed the result of Laobaiâ€™s deception and moral control. Of course, this has his own responsibility, but his responsibility is that he does not know the old-fashioned tricks and resists in time. It is not the other. So when he finally understood everything, this anger of revenge is inevitable. He is not stupid, but he is too naive. So the people in the play always call him &quot;kid&quot;?? But people of this age are no longer called &quot;kid&quot;. This is probably also the reason why the audience&#39;s evaluation is clear to him. From a practical point of view, this is a waste of the womb; and from the perspective of temperament, he is also a temperamental person who is always childlike. I am glad that the director finally told him to survive. One of the more intelligent and practical people is mike, but the scriptwriter told him to die in the hands of Laobai. It is really regrettable. Tod in the playThe depiction of d can be described as a pen of God. There are not many plays, but they are three-dimensional. As soon as he appeared on the scene, he showed the distinctive characteristics of &quot;good students.&quot; What is a good student? They worship the strong and can learn quickly, they may learn to be rigid, but there will not be any complicated emotional obstacles. Success is the only thing they want. In fact, we can see many such people in life. They don&#39;t have so many &quot;tangles&quot;, maybe not even smart, but they are often successful. They say that they are actually good, and they say that their skills are worthwhile. Their way of thinking is actually not complicated. Todd ruthlessly kills the child who rides a bicycle, which is evident from it. At that time, he probably thought that his heart would be able to get the appreciation of his superiors, but he did not think that there were many human weaknesses and complexities behind the winners. Because of this simplicity, they can learn quickly; and because of this, they are more of a learner and an imitator than a creator. If it takes time, he should soon get enough experience and go to the leadership; but he was avenged by Jesse and healed himself. His worship of power is also clearly revealed in his view of love. His embarrassment to the Chinese woman is really interesting. Of course, on the other hand, sydia is also considered to be a similar rib to him; otherwise, if another woman is changed, I am afraid that he has already noticed his attitude and even used it.",movie
535,"&quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is a family comedy film created by dissolving all kinds of classic monsters spread in the West.

Every character can subvert people&#39;s established cognition of their traditions, full of personality and vividness. More importantly, the story is suitable for people of all ages, simple and fun but not young. In the legend of the West, the Count of the Vampire Dracula is a cruel demon that specializes in absorbing the blood of the living, and the elf daughter Mavis is not a fuel-efficient lamp. As for the invisible, the werewolf, the mummy, the Frankenstein, the scorpion, the zombie Itâ€™s all people who hear the ghosts, but all the ghosts of Elf Hostel have used people as synonymous with horror. In the Elf Hostel, the vampire Dracula is still wearing a black cloak, nothing. The bloody red eyes reveal the big fangs in the mouth, but in fact he is an absolute single good quality dad, with a bitter and painful licking a niece to pull the niece, in order to make her daughter not like a wife As a human being killed, he built an old castle in the valley away from humanity, let his daughter live in it. In order to make the prostitute happy, he made the castle a holiday resort for ghosts all over the world, and held a birthday party for prostitutes every year. A good father who is rare in the world is a vampire who only eats mice and does not eat people. It looks very funny, but in fact it is extremely ironic. There is an old saying in China: If you are not afraid of a ghost, you are afraid of living. Probably that&#39;s what it means. When people pick up, it&#39;s much more powerful than a ghost. Of course, itâ€™s fascinating to let these cute ghosts sell and sell. Itâ€™s boring for a long time. The film also makes the vampire daughter talk to the human backpacker about love, while the vampire father Dracula retorted the Twilight City. The youth of the vampireOn the other hand, the relationship between human beings and his niece gradually shifted from opposition to acceptance. Although it is a story that can be thought of at the beginning, the process of this transformation is a novel and interesting process. It will not make the audience feel boring, the theater is full of laughter, and many 3D effects also make the film&#39;s picture. It is more vivid and vivid. &quot;Elves Hostel&quot; tells a meaningful alternative father&#39;s love with a relaxed story. People feel the affection, love and friendship brought by the hilarious laughter. They don&#39;t deliberately preach, but bring the connotation in the funny, if the domestic animated film is Want to win a better word of mouth more box office, &quot;Ghost Hostel&quot; is a good learning object.",movie
536,"The 74th Oscar for best original script. Also nominated Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA&#39;s best films and best directors. The little-known British screenwriter Julian Fellowes suddenly received an overseas phone call from Robert Altman, the American director, to write a script about the murder in a British manor in the 1930s. The director said that murder and crime detection are only the body. The real purpose of the film is to examine the British hierarchy, show the old-fashioned manor lifestyle that will fall, and learn about the interpersonal relationship and culture at that time. Fellowes, who had never written a script for the film before, was flattered after receiving this proposition essay. He spent six weeks submitting the first draft, and the final version will receive the Oscar for best original script. Many characters are a major feature of this film. For example, on the light upstairs, four couples, except for the male and female owners, are better recognized. The other three pairs of me did not know who the husband is. A large number of character relationships and behind-the-scenes stories are brought out in the gossip and flashing shots, so the amount of information is thought to be a heavy masterpiece adaptation. In such a hunting party, the well-dressed aristocrats sang on the scenes, and they tried their best to intertwined each other. However, the servants who were busy and sneaked were not leisurely generations, but each of them had their own secrets. The murder of the male owner gave the taste of Agatha Christie in the second half of the film. Many people in the closed space were suspected at one time; but the director arranged a confused detective, and the real discerning person was hidden in the most inconspicuous corner. At this point, the film has given enough irony and contempt for the &quot;upstairs class&quot;, there are too many hypocrisy and indifference; the protagonists of the &quot;downstairs class&quot; have blood and flesh, love and hate, even the two murderers are given sympathy. The film has portrayed and questioned the opposition of the two classes many times, showing that the servants are smarter and more capable than the main people, suggesting that such a social structure will not last long. A similar theme is further elaborated in the British television series Downton Manor, which was broadcast ten years later. In fact, this film is the source of inspiration for Downton, but there are fewer dark faces in Downton, and the owners are more flattering. In the old age, Maggie Smith once again appeared in &quot;Downton&quot; as an old lady who loves to pick up a whisper. The interesting thing is that it is called Grantham. The film is called Trentham. The film is presented at the major awards ceremony.There are countless names, but the winning rate is quite low. One of the seven Oscar nominations, the best original script mentioned above, the rest including the best film and best director lost to &quot;Beautiful Mind&quot;; the fate of the Golden Globe is similar, 5 of the 5 nominations This time, this is Hall of Fame director Robert Altman&#39;s last important non-honorable award? The best director of the Golden Globe Award; returning to his hometown of England, although the film won the best British film of the year, but the nine nominations only The results of the two items are not satisfactory (the other is the best clothing design). It is worth mentioning that Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith both used the film to swept the best supporting actress nominations for the three awards, but Jennifer Connelly, who looked at the same year, could only sigh in this way. In the movie of the All-Star team, everyone has too few plays.",movie
537,"When I finished watching the film, I was absolutely shocked, and it was absolutely awesome. I believe that many directors have seen Nolan&#39;s film, and now many of them will adopt a one-person narrative technique. Come on. This sorrow, this impulse, this desire, comes from the uncertain silence of desire. Before you have an absolute bully, please don&#39;t feel that you are very good. The society is the one who shoots the birds. Don&#39;t just trust a person, because now you can only believe in yourself. There is also beauty, why do you have an affair, is it, in a society where materialism is flowing, now money has become the absolute king. Many dignity, love, and even family ties are not worth mentioning at all. Super-powerful editing, super-narious narrative, although very short, is very exciting.",movie

539,"When I waited for &quot;The Heirs,&quot; I was curious as to which drama was always overtaken, and I opened the &quot;secret&quot; with a hand. First of all, the name of the Tucao has not been creative. It is definitely not a secret degree. It is a secret to kiss the soul of the wife and daughter. After reading the three episodes, I made sure that the writer must have put on the vest to write in our big Jinjiang, and the label must have a sad love relationship (hand fist!) The plot is very vulgar but the abuse is good enough, the male two drives the car to kill the male one. Love, the woman to help the top sin, the result did not expect the male to stare at the woman like a chicken blood, can not see her a little better, in the sixth episode appeared in the classics of abuse and abuse to the peak The line &quot;Without my permission, you can&#39;t die!&quot; This is how to shake M and shake S to say such a cool and handsome arrogant little words. This drama like a man must be like me. The shaking M, every time I watched him in the dark to monitor the female lord, there will always be a thrill of brain congestion, this feeling is that ordinary people can not understand the drop! On the road of nostalgia, I can only be a junior. I am too advanced and subtle. I canâ€™t usually tear my tears through TV dramas. Only this simple and straightforward sadism can ruin me! Many people spit the female master Mary Su, in fact, I think it is okay, this is much better than the idiot female owners in many novels. She is by no means an unconditional Madonna. Her sin is just to see the wrong person. She is mainly abused by the male owner. The gas field is too strong, the method of abuse is too rough, and the man is too scum. Speaking of the second man, it is really a place worthy of sympathy for him. The second woman will actually have a good impression on such a male second. It is really my titanium dog eye! In fact, in the face of the behavior of the male master, I think the summary of the female second is in place. &quot;You just want everyone to see your pain, you are just playing tricks.&quot; Give this sentence a 10,000 praise! This type of man has appeared countless times in the small words, from Xue Shao in the Daming Palace word to the classic abuse of BOSS Le Junkai, all of which are of a type. The ending of men and women is better predictable, not sadness to death is to turn a god to turn HE, but rather to curious about the development of female two and male two, a strong concern...",movie
540,"Data quantification is the basis of using data. In the era of big data, quantification is more important, but perhaps more important is the determination and grasp of goals. There is a saying that says: Don&#39;t think that you have a hammer in your hand, you will treat everything as a nail. In fact, the same is true for quantification. In many cases, people use the wrong method and the wrong standard, and finally quantify the error, and even quantify it for quantification so as to completely betray the purpose. And this &quot;data-based decision-making&quot; tries to propose a solution to this problem from a certain perspective. The author&#39;s point of view is just like the original translation of the book. How to quantify everything, in fact, quantification is not so much a method, but rather a change of concept. Everything can be quantified, but the quantitative standard and the reference system are different. The answer to how many buckets of water in a lake depends on the size of the barrel rather than the number of barrels. The question of how many golf balls can fit in a room is actually to think about it. The way and process... Quantification is always served for the purpose. The more common purpose is to better manage and make decisions. Quantification makes many difficult-to-determine situations become predictable and judgeable, and future-oriented decision-making and management are more The credibility and feasibility of implementation. â€œNo quantification, no management; first quantification, post-decisionâ€, these twelve words count the importance of quantification, which is often ignored. For example, a lot of data rankings are for high scores, but there is no room for improvement. It is not that a book with a score of 8 points is better than a book with 7.5 points. How many times do you have to look at it? People evaluate and evaluate whether the overall is high or high or low... Quantification is not the pursuit of precision, but the determination of probability and the law of discovery; not to eliminate uncertainty but to reduce uncertainty. Especially in the era of big data, analytic data is more related to relevance rather than structure. Quantitative data is not necessarily expressed by digital. Such a change of ideas may be a breakthrough for data analysis and quantification. Purposeful grasp. Quantifying happiness is not the famous question &quot;Are you happy?&quot; It is not a general so-called happiness index, but to find out which factors can make people&#39;s happiness improve; those factors can make people&#39;s happiness decline. The relative data quantification is the so-called collection of happiness factors, and the purpose of quantification is to make people consciously do more things that can enhance happiness. Quantification is to distinguish, to distinguish, to reduce uncertainty and make better decisions, thus reducing unnecessary waste and risk. The book also covers notThere are few methods and steps, you can choose to use and refer to the corresponding steps for a variety of different purposes, which are very practical methods, worthy of review and study. Jumping away from the technical level and talking about ideas alone, this book is also a deepening of the big data-related thinking mode. Analyze various possibilities and corresponding values, and compare and measure them. The final result is the choice and judgment of the target. Everything involved in quantitative analysis is directly related to the ultimate goal, so that the overall quantification can maximize its value. So maybe you can add another sentence: &quot;No purpose, no quantification.&quot; This can be pushed to the individual&#39;s life and development. If you want to quantify your life, you must have a clear purpose. Is it intended to make a successful career in the world or to plan for a peaceful and affordable life? Quantification is the attempt to discover the possibilities of the future from the past, and to discover the more likely parts that are more likely to be possible. This great significance seems to be more and more obvious through the arrival of the era of big data. Everything can be quantified, see how you quantify it depends on why you quantify it. Such a core proposition is often worth thinking about, and then an operation that is not formal but follows a scientific approach. Quantitative is the value entry of big data. Since you want to go in, you must understand the grand purpose of entering, and understand that there is room for quantification and optimization.",movie
541,"This should be an animated feature film that is the least like an animated cartoon. In my opinion, the desert smoke, the long river, and the right soundtrack, &quot;Rango&quot; is more like a Western American movie. The film tells the story about fate and faith. A small lizard ended his life in a comfortable fish tank because of an accident, and began to face the challenge of survival and the meaning of life. It went to one end of the road and began a new journey. It mistakenly hit the town as a hero. For the first time, I realized the taste of power and prestige. It began to think that I was really Rango, the big hero who killed seven brothers with one bullet. The sheriff of the town, the idol of the whole people. Of course, it also discovered the ulterior motives of the mayor&#39;s adult with his own ingenuity. Just when he thought he could become a hero again by himself, the rattlesnake Jake returned it to its original shape. It was the first time it really Questioning and asking who it is, until it finds out that it is nothing more than a lonely lizard, who has never defeated. It returns to the original point and crosses the road in despair and frustration to the other side. In the scene like a dream, it met the soul of the west, &quot;Then be a hero.&quot; In fact, no one is a natural hero, and everyone who later becomes a hero must experience such tempering and trials. Face the challenges and challenges of others. Sometimes a hero doesn&#39;t need to have a burly body and a good skill. What is needed is just a strong belief and a firm sense of responsibility. The soul of the West finally said to it: &quot;No man can walk out on his own story.&quot; So Rango decided to return to the town to complete his own responsibility and mission. From pride to lowness, from low to full of faith, Rango finally found the true and true self. Although there is no brilliant past, it is Rango, the man who is destined to shine in life. To be a hero is its fate, fortunately it has recovered its own destiny. The mayor once said to Rango: &quot;People have to believe in something.&quot; Itâ€™s like the residents of the town believe in their ownLife will get better, and Rango will eventually realize that he is a hero in destiny. I think this kind of reason applies to everyone in life.",movie
542,"Originally, I didn&#39;t plan to read &quot;Uniforms&quot;, and the reasons were sufficient: First, there was no big card in the main creation, and I felt that I was not enough. The second is that the domestic suspense film really disappointed me too many times, and I didn&#39;t want to spend any more money. But looking at the introduction, my interest came up. It was also a murder and a murder case. In the mind, I thought of the American drama &quot;Criminal Psychology&quot; for the first time. When it comes to the &quot;criminal&quot; drama, I am full of guilt, and I have not made up after the short-selling in the fifth season. Now I am in the ninth season. I don&#39;t know that several agents can still be well. Or, go to the theater to support a &quot;domestic&quot; &quot;criminal psychology&quot;. &quot;Uniform&quot; is understanding, fully predicting my intentions, and &quot;criminal psychology&quot; is really not a general image. I guess there must be fans of the show in the main creation, and I have studied it in detail. The team combination mode is the same, the boss is older, can not only analyze the case, but also chasing and slamming, but also lingering in a dark past, the younger ones are young, sunny and handsome, plus forensic, identification Branches and technical departments helped out, and went around to piece together the case. In addition to brainstorming and evidence, there are also a number of fierce wrestlings. After the fierce murder, they compete against each other and advance in line, and finally settled in the thrilling rescue. After watching the film, I feel like I watched a long episode of &quot;criminal psychology&quot;, and even a few key reversals, like the point in time when the advertisement was inserted. Of course, there is no &quot;criminal psychology&quot; in the &quot;uniform&quot;, but otherwise it is estimated that the real murderer will be handcuffed, which can allow him to pretend to be mixed into the Public Security Bureau. This of course is not a bug, nor is it unfamiliar to the mainland public security business, but a profile such a means of solving crimes, which will of course be dismissed by many viewers as a god stick, far less acceptable than a solid criminal investigation. When the imported goods are grafted to the locals, a fine &quot;Chineseization&quot; process is required. The &quot;uniform&quot; masters take into account the audience&#39;s ability to accept, and will not produce acclimatization, more suspense movies, spy wars, etc. than those that follow the American drama. More heart. The film is very short, less than 90 minutes. Basically, the American drama relies on the scene to promote the plot. The story is small and refined. Most of them are closely related to the case, and there is no nonsense. Even those seemingly lyrical talks. , have other intentions. The human touch is a little thinner and weakens the misdirection of the crime film, but from a storytelling perspective, the rhythm is very comfortable. Whenever you feel that this place is really superfluous, it should be turned into a urine point, and subsequent development will tell you that this is indispensable.bedding. Whenever you feel that this detail is so mentally handicapped and insulted to IQ, the script will always show its skill: Hey, I have already thought of it, don&#39;t want to pick me. Xu Ruo? In the rain, the &quot;small fresh Taiwanese drama&quot; wind, my neighbors shook their heads, hey, too fake is too play, I also think that it is a typical over-act, but after reading it, here Actually, I can justify myself, and over is quite reasonable. Of course, there are still some problems. The writers seem to be a little obsessive-compulsive, and all the fine details thrown out should be echoed. In fact, some do not matter, it does not matter, the climax part one by one, the result is a slowdown. Rescue should be a matter of life and death. If you say &quot;retrospective&quot;, you should say a few words, and the metamorphosis will be less and more perfect. Ren Dahua, who was nearly sixty years old, dared to fight and dare to fight. Last year, I watched &quot;Hunting&quot;. He died in Zhang Jiahui, and let me squeeze a sweat. I knew that Zhang had already trained a horrible scorpion. In &quot;The Uniform&quot;, he appeared as a sportsman and played bicycle racing with young people. He fought several times in the fierce battles, and the brutal melee on the construction site, the climax part of the game, and looked really unbearable. On the contrary, several younger generations sat on the bench. Fang Youwei&#39;s position is the captain. Putting the United States is the captain level. The work of kicking the door in the American drama is generally not personal. The team&#39;s hard work has set an example for the mainland public security, and I am awe-inspiring. Beyond the cruelty, there are some funny places to laugh. Chen Sicheng played the insurance manager, savvy and sophisticated, with a charming personality in the world, full of the &quot;gummy candy&quot; characteristics of the business world&#39;s old birds, the first half of the debut, there are people who have a tongue against the gangster laughter. After he was revealed, I was even more afraid. Is this specifically for the black insurance company? There are a number of screenwriters in this film, and it is not safe to be insured by an insurance company. What&#39;s more interesting is that Gao Qunshu, who made a debut, screamed at me. The audience in the theater still didn&#39;t recognize it. It was silent, but when he shook his head and opened his mouth, the audience was broken. The high guide is too cute, it is a pity that you don&#39;t play cosplay in such a good theme.",movie
543,"When it comes to modern movies, you can&#39;t help but mention Korean movies. When it comes to Korean movies, I have to mention a lot of great directors. Park Chan-yu is one of the most unnegligible ones. As everyone knows, Park Nong-yu, known as &quot;Mr.Revenge&quot;, was not born in the film class. When studying at Xijiang University in South Korea, although he was studying philosophy, most of the university time was used by Park Chan-yu to watch movies. Some people in the Korean film industry have said that &quot;no one has seen more movies than Park Chan.&quot; This is evident. Watching Park Chanyu&#39;s movies often gets a split-style experience. In those beautiful pictures and compositions, the despicable heroes are pressed by the cruel fate and can&#39;t move. In the end, the way they choose to resist is revenge. The &quot;Revenge Trilogy&quot; is undoubtedly the most representative work of Park Chan. With very few dialogues and background music, he stripped the cruel reality from the calm appearance and destroyed the truth, goodness and beauty to the audience. In the shooting technique, Park Chan-yu established his own style early. The bird&#39;s eye view, still camera and fixed position are the three lens languages â€‹â€‹that are more obvious in Park Chanyu&#39;s image style. The bird&#39;s eye view is also often called the perspective of God. The characters under such a lens usually look very helpless, and the audience looks at the ants on the earth like God. &quot;I want revenge&quot; Zhong Ayou appeared three times in the river where children often go to play. These three times are accompanied by a bird&#39;s eye view. The first time I played with my sister as a child. The second time was to bury the body of my sister. The third time I was killed by Dongjin. In this way, Park Chan-yu emphasized the helplessness of A-Yu in the face of destiny. Another favorite of Park Chanyu is the still picture. This Japanese director&#39;s favorite technique, represented by Kitano Takeshi, is extremely easy to create absurd and contrasting visual effects. In the &quot;Old Boy&quot;, Wu Daxiu had such a shot when he was discharged from prison and Meitaoâ€™s house-to-house steamed dumplings. This kind of scene will give the audience an awkward contrast effect. In confessing the relationship between characters and drama, Park Chan-yuâ€™s love for fixed seats is obvious. Whether indoors or outdoors, the fixed view angles are used to fix the characters and their actions in the frame, creating a feeling of depression and restlessness. But at some point, some violent and bloody shots are left outside the frame of the deliberately left, leaving only the background sound, which in turn produces a more cruel and more violent effect. This restrictive narrative perspective further magnifies the dramatic effects of the tragic fate of the protagonists in Park Chanyu&#39;s films. Pudovkin used toSaid that &quot;the basis of film art is editing.&quot; The clips in Park Zanyu&#39;s film are also unique. In his films, the connection between the lens and the lens is never restricted by time and space, and is quite simple and effective. If Park Jang-yu is a humanist exaggerated, then we can at least treat him as a humanistic caregiver. Park Chan-woo&#39;s film is often like a fable story. His people who have been greatly influenced by the ancient Greek tragedy focus on the bottom of the society. He is obsessed with how the people face and how they choose when life happens and changes. How to revenge. A tour, big show, gold, without exception, are the people who live at the bottom of the society, and are the poor people who are stepped on the feet of the wealthy people who are high above. In the face of sudden fate and ridicule in the face of fate, they all become cold, bloody and cruel. This is also the only choice in those closed spaces in this Park Zangyu movie. Ayou was dismissed from the factory and was abducted by the organ trafficking group to cut off the kidneys. When the whole society put him on the soles of his feet, he completed the transition from good to evil almost overnight. However, as an avenger and an avenger, he eventually died under the sword of Dong Jin who avenged his daughter. And as the avenger, Dong Jin died in the knife of the Avengers who avenged the British and American. Wu Daxiu was a arrogant and arrogant middle-aged man. Because he had no intention of spreading the unfaithful love between Li Yuzhen and his sister Li Xiuya in his youth, he was retaliated by Li Yuzhen with a series of carefully planned actions in a few decades. After being released from the black jail, he became the Avengers with fifteen years of hatred and anger. However, in order not to let her daughter know about her own unspeakable truth, Wu Daxiu chose to use self-harm to try to get Li Yuzheng to forgive. As an avenger, he eventually became the biggest victim of Li Yuzhenâ€™s revenge. Ayou and Daxiu are also avengers, and the avengers who are also arranged by fate to be revenged by others, but the price of Ayou is their own life, and Wu Daxiu loses the ability to speak, and finally we canâ€™t live with Meitao. And knowing the life. Unlike them, the gold as a weak woman turned into a vengeful vengeful goddess after a thirteen-year prison. However, under the struggle of not reporting and not reporting, the right to revenge was given to the families of the victims. This time, Park Chan-yu chose her to become the judge of the society. Park Chan-yuâ€™s movie is like this. Through revenge, the beauty is destroyed to the audience.And then tell us that this is a tragedy. Although the fate of the protagonist in the &quot;Revenge Trilogy&quot; is closely related to &quot;vengeance,&quot; there has been a marked change in the ideology of director Park Chanyu. This may be seen as a mapping of the director&#39;s own fate. Park Chan-yu only filmed three feature films before the &quot;Revenge of Revenge&quot;. The first &quot;The Moon is the Dream of the Sun&quot; and the second &quot;Triple&quot; are extremely personal and have obvious imitation traces. The box office is bleak and the word of mouth is not satisfactory. After a long period of time in his life, he met and seized a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity----taking the JSA Common Security Zone, a landmark film in both his personal and Korean film history. The film has won double recognition in business and word of mouth, but the biggest significance is to make Park Zanyu become a contemporary Korean director, and to a certain extent, he has more in the next creative process. Space and greater rights. Park Chan-yu is not a prolific director. After the &quot;Revenge of Revenge&quot;, he has successively produced movies such as &quot;Robot Love&quot;, &quot;Bat&quot; and &quot;Stoke&quot; which are closer to the mainstream or Hollywood. There have been many different evaluations in the media, but it is undeniable that the &quot;Revenge Trilogy&quot; has an epoch-making and milestone significance for both Park Chan-yu and Korean movies. One person who has seen the &quot;Revenge Trilogy&quot; friend feels that Park Zhanyu is mentally ill and always makes the audience uncomfortable. The author cannot agree with this simple and rude judgment. Although Park Zanyuâ€™s films are often tainted with violence and crime on the surface, in fact, not only the â€œrevenge trilogyâ€, all of Parkâ€™s works are concerned with humanity in â€œugly and evilâ€ and â€œgood and beautifulâ€. Such a choice and struggle in the state of the two poles. Perhaps like the end of &quot;Old Boy&quot;, Park Chan-yu did not give us a clear answer, but he still uses his most unique perspective to propose one after another bloody problem that makes us feel at a loss.",movie

545,"Advancing with the times, practically speaking, when a girl becomes a woman, her mind is fluctuating and volatility. She is not conservatively closed. It seems to be commonplace to roll sheets, moon throws, and one-night stands. The balance between tradition and conservativeness is Change quietly. Some college students, even for iphone, ipad, designer bags, high-end clothing, dating strangers, dating, rolling sheets, donâ€™t say anything rude and vulgar, to despise, this social phenomenon has the same learning In the upper class, the actual situation is not &quot;upper&quot;, &quot;upstream&quot; is not &quot;downstream&quot;, and not &quot;downstream&quot; is divided into the ranks of brain and mentally handicapped. A female student said that the monthly throw of money transactions is prostitution. Itâ€™s better to have a real gift, which makes the moon throw a bit of a style. Pushing the door of the operating room, the woman did not complain, no noise, no tears. They know what the outcome will be, when the cold scalpel smashes the lustful seed in the uterus. In addition to the trembling of the woman, the woman fell into the bottom of the loneliness, can not find any emotional cloak, no lover outside the door, no husband to accompany, and some, just a string of payment figures, waiting for confirmation, signing. The blessing of rolling sheets is a short-lived joy of fish and water, and it is a little bit of love in the depths.

Maybe after many years, the woman is only embarrassed, but she has not regretted it, but after all, the scar in the body is buried in the body, and the pain can only be said to herself in the middle of the night. Zhang Yu took her new work and interviewed the reader. In comparison, Zhang Yuâ€™s second book is more targeted than the first one. The content of the design is more professional and specific. Women&#39;s body structure, physiological structure, conditioning the body, self-examination of small common sense. Zhang Yu has worked in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology for many years. Through her deaf and heartfelt experience, she has described a lively &quot;good pregnancy&quot; event for us. If a woman does not understand her body and does not know how to care for her body, one day, the disease will hold a &quot;good pregnancy&quot;. Various choices of reluctance to cut love will be placed in front of women, men will not bear the pain of women, sweet words may ease the pain of women, but after all, the knife falls on the woman, what men can do, In addition to playing with the skin, you can&#39;t do anything else. If one day, the man feels tired, he said, &quot;The three-legged shackles are hard to find. The two-legged women are still not easy to find.&quot; Get rid of the injured woman and hook up the new hunter.Things, at the time, women can only admit that they are unlucky, facing the suffering of the enemy. The female body is the Pandora&#39;s Box, which opens it with surprises and evil magic. Unexpected pregnancy is a premarital sex, the most headache, the contraceptive measures are unfavorable, blind pursuit, the sexual well-being. The &quot;good pregnancy&quot; that meets unexpectedly. It will affect the development of emotions and affect the future life of two people. There is such a passage in the book, &quot;Treatment, to save people, supplemented by medicine, where there is no need for needles, where needles can be used, no surgery.&quot; Injury is painful for anyone, from Take the meat from the body, no matter whether it is good or bad meat, the psychological pressure, the pain of the skin, you can feel a little bit, the damage is reduced to the minimum, of course, the best. But in the hospital, anything happens, and some doctors give up their professional ethics and chase fame and fortune.

Some people can&#39;t afford children, some for the children, one dead and two lives. At the beginning, the good sister Linlin, with a very low probability, shot down. I donâ€™t want to lose my job, I donâ€™t want to cause a sensational effect, I can only slow down my plan and self-conservative treatment. Some women, although they are doing personal flow, but the damage suffered by women&#39;s bodies is not small. The unformed little life is thus deprived of the power to survive.

In the first part, Zhang Yu implicitly described simple medical common sense and social views. And this book, through accurate medical terminology, detailed medical knowledge, readers will deepen the common sense of understanding gynecological diseases. It is not easy to be a woman, especially after satisfying sexual blessings, to bear certain risks and endure accidents. Therefore, women must know how to maintain and protect their bodies, and hold the cost of rolling sheets to get better and healthier.",movie
546,"Previously, I had no concern about &quot;I am a blind date&quot;, but I went to the spotlight and found that it was a commercial film that hit the Singles Day. The combination of Han Xue, Du Haitao, Li Jiahang and Xie Yilin obviously took the stars. Nowadays, in the fast life of brilliance, blind date has become an indispensable program for young people. Then, Han Jing, who has participated in the &quot;Jianghu Qiaojiaren&quot; and &quot;Life and Death&quot;, is naturally reluctant to give up this opportunity to let &quot;I am a blind date&quot; on the eve of the inflamed Singles Day. The film has three clues: &quot;Fu II&quot; Tai Ziye Zhao Shuai died chasing &quot;the workplace strongman&quot; Bai Jingjing, &quot;stupid girl&quot; Qi Qiao encounter &quot;Qianmen male&quot; Scout, as well as the otaku Jiang Xiaoyu and the female writer Mi Xue&#39;s online dating The story walks in the virtual and reality, and finally a series of ridicules in the bustling demon. The director made such a romantic comedy, which was obviously affected by the film &quot;Peach Blossom&quot;, &quot;Love Call Transfer&quot; and &quot;Love Repair Station&quot;. After all, a few stories are spelled together, saving time and effort, and the audience can freely choose the clue that they love to watch. Li Jiahang and Han Xue combination are the most eye-catching, and the so-called handsome men and women, everyone loves to watch. In particular, Li Jiahang, who looks like Lin Zhiying, actually imitated &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and pulled up the violin in front of the beloved woman. It is quite romantic. When Han Xue attended the party, wearing a low-cut dress, the kind of amazing, even a group of big men shouted &quot;too seductive crime&quot; &quot;too temperament&quot;, you are not amazing? To be honest, I didnâ€™t even think that the Chinese fans would not think of it. And HOLD Sister Sisters decorated five girls with different styles, and the otaku men launched the &quot;Metro Flash&quot;, and even smashed all the weaknesses of secular women. Xie Haitaoâ€™s slamming man, who is careful to save money, is even more jaw-dropping. The author thinks that the online dating is still the most romantic. After all, men love to open their hearts, and the feeling of being around the lover is very heart-wrenching. For example, driving together, subway, and communicating with each other is very realistic. Nowadays, the mainland film market seems to be getting more and more popular, and the audience&#39;s requirements for the quality of the film are getting higher and higher. If you want to share a piece of the cruel market, you can&#39;t touch the audience without thinking. Looking at so many mainland love comedies every year, how many people are really impressed? The film works with good reputation and box office harvests are rare. Most of the domestic films are still too rough, and they can only be used as cannon fodder in the brutal market competition. However, &quot;Lovelorn 33 Days&quot;, &quot;Seattle&quot;, &quot;To Youth&quot; and other romantic comedies are frequent at the box office. Even the imported films are not afraid, it seems to give &quot;I amThe blind date is mad. I think that the film is selected in the same period as Stalingrad, Elf Hostel, and Golden Shell. It is definitely a wise move. In this film, Han Jingâ€™s director continued to copy commercial entertainment films such as â€œPeach Blossomsâ€, â€œLove Call Transferâ€ and â€œLove Repair Stationâ€, relying on platter love comedy to create funny and romantic. And Zhao Shuai denounced Han Xueâ€™s rumor, more like a declaration of all the â€œwhite Fumeiâ€ left women, you donâ€™t want to be a cow, donâ€™t take the job as an excuse, cherish love, get rid of the â€œremaining fightersâ€ early, and the youth of Tuen Mun Those money-saving tips also seem to tell you some social issues. From the beginning of the &quot;City of Love&quot;, &quot;Destiny Call Professional&quot; box office sales, to &quot;True Hearts Adventure&quot;, &quot;I am a blind date&quot; and more and more films, such films desperately subvert the funny and love, and in advance in the Singles Day After death, the market and the audience are waiting to watch the show.",movie
547,"A mother rented an apartment with four children, but only introduced the eldest son to the landlord. Other children were secretly brought in the suitcase. In order to avoid the suspicion, the four children were hiding in a small room all day long. Only the eldest son would go out to buy shopping and then make food for the younger siblings. Mothers who often return home late at night have fewer and fewer homes recently, and sometimes have no news for several days. When I left last time, I said that I must come back at Christmas, and I will never return. Seeing that the only cost is spent, it is as if the ants on the hot pot are asking for it, selling valuable items, and the little girl students who have made the remedy are still relieved. The younger brother was naughty and ran outside to play, and the little sister fell down and injured the chair, so that she could not know what to do. In the end, the younger sister died and several people put the body of the younger sister into a suitcase. The Ming and the young girls took the night and pulled to the river where they could see the plane flying over and buried the body. The remaining three children will continue their lives. The film was directed by the Japanese talent director, Yu Yu and directed, according to the 1988 West Nest Duck abandoned baby incident. Several children who have no acting skills have been with Yu Yu and have been with them for more than a year. In the absence of a complete script, the director has finally finished filming the film that has been brewing for more than a decade. The film shocked the world once it was released, and won 21 nominations for the International Awards and won 13 awards. In one fell swoop, Mingâ€™s actor Liu Leyoumi became the youngest filmmaker at the Cannes Film Festival. Japanese singer Kawahara Yukiko also won the Best Supporting Actress Award in Japanâ€™s &quot;The Movie&quot; with her motherâ€™s image, although this is only the debut of Kawahara Yukiko. There is a class of people in the world who look like normal people. In fact, their inner thoughts are not people. It is this group of people who want to interpret the film. The real abandonment incident is much more shocking than the film. In the director&#39;s heart, it has been lingering for more than ten years, showing the extent to which the director&#39;s mind is shocked. In order to make this profound performance especially natural, the film&#39;s shooting techniques are almost documented. Ming alone wanders in the street, squatting in the vicinity of the school, debate with selfish mothers, daily life of brothers and sisters at home. It seems that the normal life state, all kinds of unremarkable life scenes, sometimes let the audience mistakenly think that this is just a romantic picture of adolescence. With the deepening of the plot and the cruelty of the end, everyone suddenly realized that no humanity can be as natural as it is, even in the presence of each of us, all the time, just, thatThey are all stories that no one knows.",movie
548,"Someone on the watercress said that it was ugly, dark, and the dog blood. Very doubtful, the film was originally good, why is the score of the watercress only 6.8 points? Very strange! I admit that the whole film has always been dull and slow-paced, especially in the shadow of the slow piano music, it is very quiet. Let the audience enter this state (same as the so-called energy field and gas field? Is it the creation of the atmosphere or feeling?), the ending of the story is finally solved by a text message, perhaps the reason why the director is so designed. The above is a response to some of the opinions that most bean friends criticize this film, and it can also be called &quot;sophistry.&quot; Ok, let&#39;s talk about movies. Next there is a description of serious spoilers and storylines. If you haven&#39;t seen it, please bypass! In prison, the four villains were under the &quot;steel bar&quot; body and almost died. The movie will start from here. He is cold, why should he do this? do not know! Maybe it is to protect his daughter (Xu Xue). Xu Hanlin is a famous music conductor. He possesses a strong desire for psychology and is very strict with regard to fostering women. He often resorts to domestic violence after drinking. Wang Yuanyang (played by Liang Jiahui) and Xu Yiyun were lovers. When Xu Yiyun was 19 years old, he was pregnant. Fortunately, the child was born safely. On a rainy night, Xu Yiyun took the opportunity to call Wang Yuanyang and wanted to take the children away. However, he was discovered by his adoptive father and beaten by him. When he fell, he was stabbed to death by sharp weapon. The high-ranking celebrity musician falsified the scene, opened the door, recorded the scene, and blamed Wang Yuanyang. Naturally, the police who did not find the truth (ignorance) quickly let him go to jail (heavy, confessed, Wang Yuanyang also went from the beginning of the &quot;cry&quot; to &quot;confessed guilty&quot;; for such a tough guy, confession is useful, but never Will move his will. The only thing that can make him confess is the hope that he can live in prison? His daughter). After being imprisoned, Wang Yuanyang from the initial suicide, and then to the self-training bones in the later period, hit 1:4 in the 1:4, and became a person in prison who no one dared to provoke. In prison he learns knowledge, goes online, and learns a lot. Therefore, people still have to have a goal, have a hope, and have a support. Twenty years later, he was released from prison and was arranged by a relevant department to work in a music library. (The subjects are excellent at the time of school, and they are very talented in music. They are also Asian chess champions. It is a very high IQ. Step by step, planning and thinking should be Not bad). After experiencing the separation of family members, it is bound to always meet. Wang Yuanyang accidentally discovered his daughter, Xu Xue. At this time, Xu Hanlin will stillAs a daughter, Xu Hanlin still has a domestic violence and a perverted heart. Wang Yuanyang rented a house on the opposite hill to monitor Xu Hanlinâ€™s home and wanted revenge. I think so. However, the most important thing is to protect his daughter. There are always so many coincidences in life, let alone movies. Xu Hanlin once again imposed a domestic violence on Xu Xue. This time, unlike 20 years ago, when Xu Xue was beaten, he resisted, and Xu Hanlin accidentally stepped on the glass slag and fell down the stairs and fell to death (this is a legitimate defense). Well? Solve). Wang Yuanyang arrived and quietly dealt with the body, and this is exactly the scene of a person murdering in the dark at the beginning of the movie. Since then, the suspect (Wang Yuanyang) step by step to attract the police to his own sight, deliberately attracted the police, leaving physical evidence such as buttons. What for? Because he is her father. Without a word, the father&#39;s love is silently expressed. After reading the film, I was thinking, behind the celebrity&#39;s head, what evil heart is there? Why are there always some officers and police officers eager to arrest and find evidence? Will there be bribes in the early cases? Nothing to know! Like the police officer Lin Zhengzhong played by Ren Dahua in the movie, he admires me. He loves to think, he is good at judgment, and his ethics, and what he said: The purpose of handling a case is to (close to) the truth. Perhaps Lin Zhengzhong is not a competent father, this is what his daughter will judge, but as a police officer, this is the goal that should be pursued. The case is not to close the case, to bring people into jail, but to be close to the truth, fair and just - I admire. Of course, this is my opinion. In this regard, bean friends have different opinions. Bean friends said that Lin Zhengzhong&#39;s wife&#39;s fragment is too redundant, and long, incomprehensible, and has nothing to do with the entire film. Personally, if there is no suicide by Lin Zhengzhong&#39;s wife, there will be no reason why he has been pursuing this five-year case (Lin Zhengzhong does not believe that he will commit suicide and kill him). Because the pursuit of the truth, will be able to pull out the case many years ago, will lead to the case of this film, seemingly unrelated fragments and the connection of the entire film is such a clever design. No? To illustrate the situation, I used a brush to draw a diagram of the person diagram and important events behind the door, and I found some signs. I like to watch movies, and I like to analyze the reasons for drawing analysis. I think this is closer to the characters and angles inside and outside the film. In fact, every film, like everyone, always has advantages and disadvantages. If you always look at the good and bad, or leadHow to play dog â€‹â€‹blood, how bad the editing, how the color tone... Maybe this is also a kind of angle thinking, but this is not my way of thinking. I always think that anything can always find highlights, and this can help me grow, and I can learn from it, and this is already a film, or the harvest that the characters bring to me. This is enough. I think this is a very bad article, yes, very bad, because it took more than half an hour to write it, but it took nearly an hour to rewrite it, and changed N many times, always failing to achieve the desired effect. It may be that I haven&#39;t written an article for a long time, maybe I can&#39;t think too much and can&#39;t follow a way of thinking. Maybe the good article was originally made in one go, not changed. However, since it is posted, life always needs some real elements, even if it is not perfect, or it is bad.",movie
549,"This feeling comes from the fact that one of the stories is a drama school filled with various theories and performance methods, and the teacher&#39;s teaching process is full of formality and looks like a performance. News from teachers and students from another high school in Abigail&#39;s high school became the material of the annual drama of the students of this drama school; students kept performing various performance exercises and tried to get close to the event in various ways. The protagonist is to achieve the reality of the performance, and the emotional reaction that the male protagonist Stanley is in, which does not know whether it should be due to performance or real. From the center of the storm? The direct response of the protagonist female students Victoria and Saladin to this matter has not been described positively. Just like the toque of the tornado is exactly the most calm, they are not happening. Have a relationship? How do they choose each other? When did they start the relationship? . . . All this is like a black hole that attracts the attention and curiosity of all, and then swallows into the endless silence. No one has the courage to ask the answer, just dare to rehearse in his own mind, trying to restore the truth of self-righteousness. Of course, the most important thing is from the author Elinor Carton, the way in which everyone talks to each other in the book, the written rational structure and straightforward, as if the characters on the stage always use the lines of their words. Speaking the same, they talk about their own views on each other, their views on the news, their own confusion, and even their own fantasies, as if a big drama was staged in front of the readers. The style is very calm, and people can&#39;t see the habitual writing of a young writer who substitutes himself into a certain role and perfuses a certain piece of life experience on this character. So the drama comes from the real, but also the real thing, but when you think that they are all true, Victoria and Saladin will appear inadvertently in the lines, reminding the reader: &quot;Hey, we have not paid for these claims. Therefore, the rehearsal is a play, and the rehearsal itself is like a defense mechanism, that is, the process that the students of the drama school must go through in order to complete the performance work, and also the preparation for the children to enter the world of adults. Because the child always seems to have the opportunity to come back again, then growth is like a test of the final achievement of a human being. On the way to the adult world, the children try to live the same life as adults, love and sex. , pain and confusion... they feel the same emotions and express the same reaction, but alwaysThere is a little staggered distance. Like the story of the heroine Victoria&#39;s sister Isolde, she stood near the real thing, but did not know anything. In this book, the author wrote several teachers. Just like the teachers in our memory, I rarely remember the names directly. I always use the subjects as the name: performance teacher, physical teacher, vocal teacher... but the author is shaping the drama school. The only teacher who has a clear face is the saxophone teacher. She is sometimes calm and calm (generally facing the parents) and sometimes gentle and kind (generally facing the children). In the book, she provides the most relevant dialogue: &quot;Remember, for your daughter, all the life knowledge she has accumulated over the years, compared to everything she will experience in the future, is just a kind of Rehearsal. Remember that what she is most interested in is that everything goes in the wrong direction....&quot; She broke the essence and lost herself in her emotional world. The children told her that it was like a teacher who taught skills. It was like a psychiatrist. Isolde, Julia, and Brigitte came here to wipe the instruments and reveal their hearts. She looked at them like looking at them. The self of a certain node, to some people to resonate, to give some people guidance, to give some people a paradox. Thanks to this year&#39;s Booker Prize, not only has it improved the housing conditions of Caton, but also the lines of her virginity and fangs in this debut, not buried in a pile of foreign novels to earn people&#39;s tears. The story and the suspenseful plot of thousands of turns. Even if we open the pages of the book, we find that after such a complicated structure and awkwardness, we have lived like that, or have thought about it before. To revisit such thoughts, and then to carry out a self-entanglement thinking with the protagonist, there may not be such an addiction to the youthful novels of dreaming love or sublimation. After all, life needs rehearsal again and again, so that when we next play, it can shine.",movie
550,"&quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is based on the background of the vampire ancestor &quot;Dracula&quot;, and it is another way to shape the ugly, fierce and lacking kind of monsters that the audience is familiar with. Earl Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Werewolf, the so-called fascinating movie characters have come together, and the audience can feel the cute side of the monster. The Count of the Vampire Dracula is the originator of the vampire, and its own dark side is enough to chill. How such a character reverses the sinister atmosphere of the castle, and shows that the lovely warmth in the animated story has become a highlight of the film. The joy of many monsters to sell the audience can be described as the main point of the film and even the selling point of the film. The well-known science freak &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has become hugely slack, and the vampire&#39;s opposite &quot;werewolf&quot; lacks sharp teeth and becomes a dad with children. The mummy sometimes reveals that the beauty of beauty is in stark contrast to the characters we have in mind. There is no horror in the story, neither horror nor blood, but the sudden intrusion of human beings creates conflicts. However, the background of the characters that adults can understand is not applicable to domestic children. Looking at the seven gourd dolls and Altman&#39;s growing generation, little is known about the Gothic temperament of the Dracula vampire, not to mention Frankenstein and the werewolf. It is only from the appearance of the character&#39;s appearance that the younger audience is attracted, but the appearance of the fault in the background of the character will undoubtedly make it difficult for the audience to enter the picture. Family and dreams, the two factors that can&#39;t be missed in the construction of children&#39;s world, often touch the heart of the family and the dream of hard work, whether it is for adults or ignorant children is a good medicine. &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; focuses on family ties, and the character does not have the dream of being vigorous and not urging in &quot;Monster Company&quot;, but as long as you look at the disease and do a good job, it is enough to have a good reputation and box office. Throughout the whole film, the team that has been snoring has grown stronger, and the intensity of the baggage has become apparent when the film is going to the party. Using the monster&#39;s own shackles to create a sense of sensation, there will be unexpected joy and also increase the laughter in the play. Count Dracula&#39;s participation in &quot;Where is Dad?&quot; must be the kind of &quot;Barbie&quot; that is overwhelmed. For the daughter&#39;s family love throughout the film, the conflict between the two generations of family values â€‹â€‹is the main line of the film, which means that the father&#39;s love is a bit awkward, only under the skin of the tears but failed to mobilize the audience&#39;s emotions. After all, it is still difficult to integrate into the background of the story. The film is still a failure in the narrative.",movie
551,"Speaking of vampires, I believe that many people still think of the eerie atmosphere. Even with Edward, who is handsome and handsome in the Twilight City, can&#39;t change this impression, let alone the vampire. What is the most terrible Count of Dracula? However, in the animated film &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;, the former &quot;terrorist&quot; vampire Dracula count, mummies, invisible people, werewolves and Frankenstein have changed their faces and began to show others with another look and image. It should be said that at the beginning of the film, &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; still has some illusions, giving everyone the illusion that Dracula will suck blood, but when the face of the deity appears, it is only when he reaches out to tease his daughter Mephis. In fact, it has already set a funny tone for this movie. As a vampire dad, Dracula built the &quot;elf hostel&quot; to protect his daughter from human harassment. The biggest advantage of this hostel is that &quot;no one has ever been there,&quot; so it became an elf ghost. Their shelter. However, it all changed when Mephisâ€™s 118th birthday! Although he is over 100 years old, but for the vampire, Mephis is still a child. Since it is a child, there is a rebellious heart. The more Dad De Cura is obstructing him from meeting human beings, the more she hopes to meet with human beings. For this reason, Dracula did not hesitate to make the zombies pretend to be human beings, thus dispelling the idea that Mephis came into contact with human beings. However, the human boy Jonathan accidentally crashed into the Elf Hostel and fell in love with Mephis at first sight and completely disrupted Dracula&#39;s plan... So Dracula and a good friend mummies, invisible people, werewolves and Frankenstein I started to dismantle the pair and rejoice. However, the kind and optimistic Jonathan has gradually broken the good friends of Dracula with his big nerves, the right and left, and singing a good song, so that the Frankenstein and the invisible people are on their own side, even Even Dracula felt very happy with him. Especially in the section where two people play the flying table, it is the true feelings of Dracula. However, with the protection of her daughter&#39;s mentality, she eventually forced Jonathan to leave. I regret that Dracula drove out and chased it out. It coincided with Halloween. Humans dressed themselves as vampires, mummies, and Frankenstein. At this time, Dracula discovered that after a hundred years, human thoughts have long been and have not been before. The same, these monsters are not only no longer excluded, they are more liked and sought after, with this confidence, heJonathan was recovered, and a lover was finally married. For this film, there are funny bridges, but more are surprises and impressions. In particular, Dracula, despite the sun exposure, braved all the way to chasing the plane, and looked at it all. The greatness of fatherly love is actually here. And this kind of touch is no less than the surprise brought by the current &quot;Where is Dad?&quot; Of course, the most fundamental source is Jonathan&#39;s sincerity. With this spirit, he finally got the father-in-law De Cula. Therefore, those who want to deal with the relationship with their father-in-law may also wish to take the film. It is worth mentioning that the film brought together the evil spirits of the past, but did not form a wicked alliance. Instead, these evil spirits began to sell under the bottomless line, sweeping away the evil spirits and let these monsters It looks so funny and cute. The main thing is that the scary monsters in the past are very scared now. Isn&#39;t this an irony? In addition, there is also the most popular &quot;Daddy Dad&quot; plot, and joined the traditional Chinese &quot;father and daughter-in-law&quot; battle section, so it can be said that the Chinese audience is young and old. As a long-awaited Halloween blockbuster, it is worthwhile for the whole family to come to the theater to watch.",movie
552,"&quot;Da Ming robbery&quot; is a work of historical disaster theme. It reveals the living conditions and emotional state of people in troubled times around the war scenes of the Ming Dynasty. It is an excellent film that reveals complex human nature in depth. The film has highlighted a &quot;chaotic&quot; character, profoundly revealing the war hostile state of people in the &quot;troubled world&quot; and the difficult choices of individuals as individuals. The film gave up the so-called &quot;grand narrative&quot;, and did not obsessed with scanning the panorama of that era. Instead, it selected some representative scenes from the microscopic cross-sections to describe the scenes and successfully demonstrated the chaos of the troubled times. : Invasion of foreign nephews, famines, plagues, panic, chaos, helplessness, despair, especially the horror scenes of almost every family caused by the Great Plague and the death of villages have created a worldly hellish world of chaos; What is even more horrifying is that people began to abandon each other for mutual benefit and even kill each other. In order to get a few pigeons to survive, a soldier frantically killed his comrades who blocked himself, and some officers and men who were willing to commit adultery and looting civilians. And even cruelly cut their first class to take advantage of the rewards... So the hero appeared. Although this film is not an anti-hero film, it is different from many movies that promote heroes to turn the tide and save the world, but let the heroes dissolve in the long river of history. The two heroes in this film are especially short-sighted. In the face of the unsettled end of the Ming Dynasty, they lost some pride and enthusiasm, and they were more sad and sad. The building will be tilted and the house will be difficult to support. The famous generation Sun Chuanting (Dai Lijin) â€œknows that it cannot be doneâ€ and is finally ravaged by the flood of history. And go. A travel doctor Wu Youke (Feng Yuanzheng), despite his superb medical skills, saved countless people&#39;s lives with a unique anti-epidemic and epidemic theory, but was unable to prevent people from killing each other, and even unable to cure the disease, and eventually could only return to the rivers and lakes. They have the commonality of heroes? They have the courage to take responsibility. However, the two heroes in the film are most touching, but they are doing this in order to end the &quot;worldwide&quot; and end the war hostile state between people. The difficult choice of individual people. Sun Chuanting had no choice but to throw a pen from the hustle and bustle. In the troubled times, he became &quot;had to be ruthless&quot; and even arrogant. He was forced to become a person he did not want to become. His inner contradictions, entanglements and helplessness were quite tense. The biggest dilemma of Wu Youke is how should he treat and accept such a &quot;complex and chaotic&quot; Sun Chuanting? When the humanity hall of most people collapses, the love and hate of the two awakes such as Sun Chuanting and Wu Youke will be lost.Going in the direction, right and wrong, justice and evil are in a state of indecision. Can&#39;t find the hero of the opponent, and no one cheers, is it a hero? Heroes can&#39;t save Da Ming. We have to think about the question of why the mighty Daming will die. As the most powerful country in the world at that time, the curtain call of the Ming Dynasty has been going on for hundreds of years, but it has always been like a puzzle to be solved. Some people say that Daming was killed in the &quot;Resistance to the aid of the DPRK&quot; because the &quot;anti-insurance and aid to the DPRK&quot; made the Da Ming State Treasury short of losses, and the navy lost its money. Some people said that Da Ming died on &quot;anti-gold&quot; and imposed a large amount of &quot;anti-gold&quot;. The rigorous taxation caused the official to force the people to rebel; others said that Damingâ€™s death was in the suppression of â€œrogueâ€ because the peasant uprising led by Li Zicheng attacked Beijing, forcing the emperor to hang himself. However, perhaps the facts should be as shown in this film: Daming is not dead in &quot;multiple wars&quot;, and second is not in &quot;depletion&quot;. The demise of the Ming Dynasty is in no way comparable to the demise of the dynasties. . The film vividly and artistically reproduces the tragic scene of the sorrows and sorrows of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The complete political corruption from top to bottom and from inside to outside has caused the government to lose the function of relief of the people. On the contrary, the government continues. Imposing rigorous taxes and taxes is tantamount to squandering the people&#39;s downs and downs, and when the complaints are borne, the people who were the basis of the imperial rule have emerged as the enemy of the government, and a government is not far from extinction. Zhu Yuanzhang, who founded Da Ming by religious rebellion, banned the Ming dynasty. However, the &quot;rogues&quot; did not use the Ming dynasty to attack Beijing. The squadrons did not have an epidemic or the epidemic was better than the official army, but the momentum was growing.

553,"In 11 years, I was internship in Shenzhen, going to work during the day, and taking a junior high school student in the evening. The childâ€™s talent is limited and diligent, and I have tried my best and have no effect. But I accidentally read all of his textbooks carefully. The conclusion is? Then I began to reflect on a question: Why is there so many startups in Shenzhen? Why not in other places? Later, I gradually learned that Shenzhen has many investment companies and numerous incubation platforms. Compared with other places, the creativity of young people here is easier to get support. But there is not enough investment. Huaqiang North is not a little bit worse than Silicon Valley. Later, I went to work at a research institute. Of course, it is more appropriate to use miscellaneous work. This high-tech technology is still leading, I am only half-baked. However, when I came into contact with some component materials, I realized why China could not produce a first-class company like Apple. Most of the components are imported, large to cisco switches, a small circuit of the 74hc series, not domestically produced, domestic goods are not people worry. Then gradually understand that China&#39;s industrial base is fragile, without the support of excellent basic industries such as Intel, 3M, Mini, Omron, Panasonic, Texas Instruments, Corning, Sharp, LG, without these equipment, materials, components supply The continuous innovation of business, how can there be such a big man like Apple. Investment, entrepreneurial incubation is the bones, the industrial foundation is masonry, with these, in order to have a beautiful attic on the spire. The idea is always the gold wire on the Chinese dress, the jewel in the crown. If you meet again and say that Chinese students lack creativity, hehe. Looking back at the book, in fact, the content is quite rich, and the classic TRIZ, brainstorming and other theories and methods have a more detailed explanation, it is still a little inspiring. In a word, the principle can be referenced, and the case is too sloppy. There are too many slots! When a person thinks that 1+1 has more than twenty answers, there is actually no dime relationship with creativity. On page 7, a &quot;silent piece&quot; created by John Cage suddenly thought of Wang&#39;s &quot;strongest draft pick&quot;. On page 19, two new items are required to design new things. What is the significance of the nailed baseball cap on the wall! There are so many things in the world that can improve human life that need to be designed and innovated.

This is typical.After the event, Zhuge Liang, like a pig beforehand! The brainstorming method is more detailed, and this part is still of reference value. But is free and free talk really creative?

554,"Warm Bodies (2013) Warm Bodies (2013) Warm Bodies (2013) A very strange zombie movie, and still love-themed. The movie tells the romantic story of a zombie resurrected because of love. The actor is a zombie. Although he is dead, he still has feelings to speak. One day, when the actor went to eat, he saw a beautiful heroine and fell in love with her at first sight. Therefore, after the boyfriend who took the heroine&#39;s boyfriend took possession of his memory, she took her home to protect it. Within a few days, the male and female protagonists from strangers to familiar, began to like each other, which made the male protagonist recover the heartbeat. The heroine wants to go home. When she sneaked, she stunned a lot of zombies and embarrassed from zombies. The two began to escape. At the same time, the love of the male and female protagonists also restored many zombies to the heartbeat. After escaping for a while, the actor confessed to the heroine that she had eaten her boyfriend, so that the heroine secretly left home the next day. When the hero leads to the heroine, he goes home alone, but there are many zombies that have changed on the road, so everyone decided to go to the heroine and ask humans to stop them from chasing them. The male lead relies on the memory of the heroine boyfriend to sneak into the human settlement and find the heroine. The two are very happy. Subsequently, the heroine took the male lead to find her father, the highest commander of humanity. They told the father about the incident, but the father did not believe it and killed the male protagonist. The two had to escape again. At this time, the crickets have already been chased, so the heroines and zombies have fought with each other. Humans have begun to fight alongside the zombies. On the other hand, the heroine&#39;s father shot and shot the male lead, and the heroine immediately found out that he was bleeding. Everyone was shocked. In the end, the zombies gradually returned to humanity, and the hero and heroine were happy and happy together. This is a very happy movie. Although it is a zombie theme, it is a funny romantic comedy. The film has a youthful idol actor, unique laughter, bright colors, beautiful music, alternative plots, etc., is a masterpiece of a variety of elements mix and match. The movie is very simple and not much to say. The theme is popular love, the plot is imitated &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the smile is caused by several types of film differences, the end is the fairy-tale Happy End. It is this that makes the film unique and jumps out of the usual routine of zombie films, and has taken new ideas. for meIn fact, the setting of the zombie picking girl is too surprising for me! Can such an unexpectedly weird setting not appeal to the audience? In addition, the scene of the balcony that copied &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; made the film full of strange joy, so fun! I saw here that I understand why the heroine still lives in such a mansion in the world of zombie flooding. It was originally intended to imitate Juliet! In short, this is a good movie that is unexpectedly set, that is, a youth idol film, also a comedy zombie film, such a movie has not appeared in Hollywood. The filming is equally surprising. First of all, the songs in the movie are very good, and in line with the movie plot, the first capital brings a unique taste to the film. Second, the bright colors of the film are rare in zombie movies. These bright tones give the film a pleasant viewing and a positive theme. Of course, this also satisfies my needs, because I don&#39;t particularly like dark-skinned movies?? Black can&#39;t see anything clearly. Can this be called a movie? Third, the unique movement of the mirror and the editing of the film makes the film very modern. For example, although there are not many action plays in the film, the filming speeds up the rhythm of the film, which seems to be in one go, very enjoyable. From the above points, it can be seen that this is a well-positioned and creative Hollywood masterpiece, Jonathan Levine is very talented. The actors are quite satisfactory. The male and female protagonists are not handsome men and women, especially the male protagonist Nicholas Hoult is very different. His skinny appearance has nothing to do with handsome. The heroine is Teresa Palmer, who is a supporting role in Key No. 4, and this time she finally became the protagonist. Teresa Palmer looks very popular, although it is a beautiful woman, but her face is similar to many European and American actresses, such as &quot;Twilight Woman&quot;, which makes people always look awkward. So, I predict that Teresa Palmer is not red. The rest of the film is a dragon, not to mention. in conclusion. This is a very fun mix and match movie that looks very relaxing and enjoyable. It is a full-fledged commercial entertainment movie. Warm.Bodies.2013.OPEN.MATTE.720p.BluRay.x264-EbP",movie
555,"I watched an episode with a friend and then there was no more. At that time, it was mainly because the type of plot did not arouse our interest. Because there are too many people I like, I find it out later, and the results are out of control. I read the five seasons at a time. I think that some dramas still have to go slowly to discover their uniqueness. For the dying person, walter is lucky, at least he knows that he will die soon, and he is ready to do something before he dies. He also said in the play that he had slept even better since he knew he was going to die. Walter said that no matter whether we go to the production of drugs, it does not affect the amount of ice poison in this market, just as we go to make drugs, they can get more pure ice. After the whole drama was over, it was discovered that Walter had eliminated several drug lords and completely destroyed a huge ice sales network. Although those are not the purpose of his doing it, it does achieve that effect. So on the whole, Walter is a hero, a hero who is no less than Hank. In fact, Walter&#39;s initial choice of making drugs is a matter of course. In exchange for ourselves, family life is tight, life is incompetent, and suffering from cancer, just happens to meet a chance to make drugs, just can use their own expertise, although it is a violation of the law, but it will soon be alive, I estimate Anyone who is under this condition will make the same choice. The plot can develop. It can be said that it is caused by walter&#39;s insatiable greed. It can also be said that it is caused by Jesse&#39;s immaturity. In short, because of these two most important factors, the plot is full of twists and turns, and the poisonous cockroaches die one after another. They all have a hard wound, walter is a family, Jesse is a child (and a child&#39;s temper). They failed to become Bill Gates in the drug industry, entirely because of an eagerness for success and a love. Jesse seems unprofessional most of the time, but once he is professional, he can be amazed, especially when Mexico is questioned about the level of drug production, you have to make a slap! Gusâ€™s revenge in Mexico does not show up in the mountains. This is the high man. Jane is very hurt. She gave a fresh feeling as soon as she appeared, but then I was a bit skeptical that she was in contact with Je.The motivation of sse finally proves that my suspicions are shameful. Walter was very upset when she watched her struggle to die, but she was lucky. If she doesn&#39;t die, Jesse should fly away with her. She is the home of Jesse, the most perfect destination. Walter is calm and struggling. From this point of view, he is very similar to Xiaoqiang. People can get used to anything, including killing. Walter is a typical example. Although everyone he killed must be killed in his opinion, his inner feelings are getting weaker and weaker. Walter is getting stronger and stronger, and Jesse is just the opposite. He is completely surrounded by emotions, and you can&#39;t wait to trample him to death. Several people inside said to Walter that you are not suitable for this line. In fact, I think that Walter has all the qualities of doing this. On the contrary, Jesse is totally unsuitable for this line. Walter is not a normal person at all, and Jesse happens to be a normal person. Only one normal person has so much sentimentality. Although Walter is struggling emotionally, he is well controlled. At least he is sober, arrogant and decisive when he is doing business. This is not something a normal person can do. Mike said to Jesse: He is a time bomb, don&#39;t do it with him. Finally, Mike still worked with him, and he was killed. In fact, Jesse is also a bomb. It is an untimely bomb. You don&#39;t know when he will make a noise, but his bomb only blows Walter. So, on the whole: Jesse made Walter, Walter made the whole game. Seeing someone saying that the word breaking bad is mainly to describe Jesse, madly praised. But in fact, the constraints that Jesse faced were much weaker than Walter. Jesse&#39;s struggle is only in his personal psychological balance, and Walter wants to be outside, but also Anne, especially Jesse, an untimely bomb. Many people love and hate Jesse because many people can feel empathy for him because he is a normal person. He is not perfect, and he has a lot of jealousy. And Walter is not a normal person. Many of his qualities are difficult to see, so for him, IWe can only be longing for, oh, worship. Jesse looks more real and more intimate. We can find our own shadow on Jesse, but you can&#39;t find it on Walter.",movie

I used to want to escape, and I want to go out of my hometown, but now I have a warm glow in my memory. The ignorant childhood that I used to spend in a small town, and the busy teenage years, now seem to be plated. There is a layer of golden light. Now think about it is not unhappy, remember to live in the grandmother&#39;s house during the summer vacation, every time the big goose stretched out his neck and rushed to me, scared the yard to run, and finally saw a big goose neck stuck in the board.

When I grew up, I finally got away from my hometown and came to a big city. I finally lived the day I wanted, walked on the street, and never met someone I knew. I can safely wrap myself up. But now I am always thinking back, the place that carries all my good times, those laughter, those tears, those pure feelings let them all exist in my small town. A person&#39;s life is a process of gradually drifting away and gradually losing. In this process, I also lost some simplicity, lost some friends, lost a little health, and in the process I am sometimes numb, sometimes deplorable, sometimes violent. , or happy, gradually gave up a little middle-aged taste. Facing the increasingly old face, and the uncomfortable pain of the body from time to time, from being depressed to enduring the final calm, accepting everything that life has given me, and accepting it all.

560,"It is known that the Battle of Stalingrad is a fierce war. It is recorded that the two sides were estimated to have about 2 million casualties in this battle. The film &quot;Stalingrad&quot; does not describe the entire Battle of Stalingrad, but only selected the battle. A street battle in the city, and two loves between the two sides in the street battle. The Hollywood film &quot;Under the City&quot; is also based on the street fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad, but it is completely different from the Russian-directed Stalingrad. Indispensable war scenes, but relatively ruthless bullets and artillery, the film more aimed at the small people in the war and their subtle emotions. The ending is conceivable death, but the process is extended and magnified. Whether it is German or Soviet, men or women, they will eventually be ruthlessly destroyed by artillery. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; is using life to reflect on war and humanity, as well as the solemnity and nobleness of the Russian nation. Although to some extent, the excessive expression of emotional relationships and monologues in the film will test patience for some viewers who are familiar with fast-paced films, it is also understandable that this is one of the characteristics of Russian cinema. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; is just like all the excellent Russian literary works, rough, bold, heavy but delicate. From the very beginning, the film used a lot of long-lens, slow-motion and high-speed photographic lenses to magnify the cruelty of war, shuttle bullets, flying artillery fire, hit and blown soldiers, anxious burning land, and airborne, Coupled with heavy and slow music, the film is in a tragic atmosphere from beginning to end. The whole film is very poetic, and the audience is like watching a dynamic oil painting, which is both beautiful and extremely cruel. The only sunshine passage is probably the danger of the death of several Soviet soldiers guarding the building in the building. The 19th birthday party prepared for the young girl Kajia, who is waiting for them, is simple but touching, and does not say a word for half a year. The high-pitched singer also sang a song on the spot, still a sad and heavy lyric, and the best gift for the girl is a piece of soap and a dilapidated bathtub filled with hot water. In the war and the ruins, I want to clean my body. It is a luxury. There is no such thing as vulgarity and wretchedness. The feelings of Kajia and these soldiers are pure and sincere, because the soldiers guard not only her but also their country. The German officer who was born in the film as a Prussian nobleman stroking the Russian with his wife in the broken houseWomen, who communicated with the body in unspeakable language, the unrealistic love in the war, loudly accused why there is war, and this humanized setting also subverts the Germans in the mainstream of the past national ideology. Image cognition. All the wars are wrong, but the soldiers who participated in the war are not right or wrong, because they have no choice, and they are doing things that they can&#39;t help themselves in the untimely time. As a war-themed IMAX3D movie, the $30 million investment is also a huge investment in the history of Russian cinema. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; does show the temperament of an epic blockbuster, and 1:1 accurately restores the scene of war. The grandeur of the grandeur is shocking, and the details of props, art, costumes, etc. are all finely detailed. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; delicately restores the human brilliance in the brutal war, not only a war film, but also a strong and gloomy oil painting, beautiful and lyrical.

564,"Since the release of &quot;Jinling Thirteen&quot; by Zhang Yimou in December last year, the film has set off a movie-shaking frenzy due to its special selection and perspective. For a time, or the sound of a slap or a slap in the air. Before I watched this film, several friends recommended that you must go to the theater to watch. Others reposted articles about criticizing the film on social networking sites. So the author decided to see it in person. After the filming of the last two hours, the author felt that it was not enough, and downloaded the original version of Yan Geling&#39;s original novel carefully. After reading, here are some of the author&#39;s words to readers. In general, &quot;Jinling Thirteen&quot; is a popular novel. Throughout a girl&#39;s perspective, it describes the time of the horrific people experienced by Stone City in December 1937. This is the author&#39;s unique path, but I have to say that this novel focuses on the strong plot and readability and the popularity that can be accepted by the public, focusing on depicting the plot and drama conflicts. And portray an impressive figure in it. The author did not ask the fate upwards, nor did he dig deep into the deep and unpredictable, intricate, good and evil people and humanity. The writing of the novel is more traditional, the story is the first protagonist, the text is mainly based on narrative, the plot is very compact, there are few vivid scene descriptions and language descriptions, and many arguments and lyrics of the prostitute as a bystander, Shujuan, have been added. From the narrative alone, the author told us a good story with a vivid plot. However, in terms of details, the plain description makes it difficult for readers to feel immersive. We seem to be listening to a story. The author&#39;s arguments and grievances seem to be somewhat addictive and even childish and kitsch, making the author seem like a storyteller, in fact, can be fully integrated into the story and description, let the readers experience. The narrative perspective of the novel is the memory of the &quot;relatives&quot; of &quot;I&quot;. The author wrote this &quot;fiction&quot; according to &quot;memory&quot;. In fact, the author intentionally chooses this method to increase the credibility of the story, but due to the lack of vivid shock The description makes the author feel that the story is only heard by the author. The double narrative of direct narrative and indirect narrative also reveals one of the authors or the self-confidence of the story itself or its own writing ability. In the first perspective of women&#39;s novels, the author&#39;s description of the protagonist&#39;s own can be described as a slogan, especially the opening of the &quot;early wave&quot; is especially a three-pointer, butThere is a lack of positive descriptions of male characters in the novel. As a woman, in several descriptions of Miss Zhao, the author unconsciously reveals the temptation and conquest of women&#39;s invincibility for men, and the addiction of A Gu, the deputy priest and Dai Major to Miss Zhao. The author also shows irony for men. The characters in the novel are divided into five groups: female students, prostitutes, priests, wounded soldiers, and little devils. The first two are the protagonists of the novel, and the contradictions in the early stage and the death of the late prostitute girl constitute the main plot of the novel. Both the priest representing salvation and the wounded soldier representing rebellion were weakened by the author. In fact, the author intentionally or unintentionally promoted a feminist idea in this novel. In the film, the director intentionally weakened this point, highlighting the heroic power of Li instructors and priests, but still can not cover up the shadow of the original feminism. Although the author&#39;s title is &quot;Jinling Thirteen&quot;, but it is not the main character of the thirteen people. In front of the work, it seems that people want to go to the &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;-style &quot;group play&quot; mode, the image of people such as cardamom and jade. It is also very clear, but at the back end of the story, the author cleverly chose the first protagonist &quot;Miss Zhao&quot; to write a unique way. The author thinks that it is too difficult for the author to write 13 different tasks. As the first protagonist, &quot;Miss Zhao&quot; is a bit thin, only seeing &quot;experience&quot;, not seeing its delicate psychological changes, and &quot;myrtle&quot; before the death of &quot;bean&quot; is the most brilliant passage in the book. Itâ€™s just that the authorâ€™s arguments that Iâ€™ve joined later are really superfluous, so that the tragic picture freezes and the beautiful soul dance, itâ€™s perfect enough! The author believes that &quot;Jinling Thirteen&quot; lacks a clear purpose, is to show the humbleness and greatness of humanity in war? Or to show the girl&#39;s sexual enlightenment and learn to be grateful? Or is it ironclad to sue the Japanese cabinet crime? It seems that there is one point, and it seems that it is not the center? The author pays too much attention to the plot and readability of the story, but the real intention is not clear, as if to tell the world a vivid story. So everyone has their own interpretation, it is no wonder that after the film is released, the sound of praise or bad approval is endless.",movie
565,"The first half hour of the movie &quot;The Enemy&quot; made me look very interesting: the cold blue-black endless urban tones, the swaying and sloping composition created by the sinful sin atmosphere, multi-line narrative + time and space intertwined deliberately left out The suspense, and of course the role of the edge of the face, black temperament, these make me shine, and I strongly look forward to the emergence of a stylized domestic crime film like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Poor Street&quot;. For a long time, the subject matter of the case is a large minefield or even a forbidden zone of domestic movies. It is not allowed to describe the details and process of the crime too much, the theme must be positive and bright, the characters need to be righteous and evil, and the good and evil are reported, etc., not only the type of vigilance. (and related criminal movies, black film types) the vitality of film creation, let the creators stagnate. Even the vigilant movies like Du Qifeng, if they enter the mainland market, can only choose the &quot;safe mode&quot; of &quot;Police War&quot;, which is dominated by public security heroes, not to mention the young directors with limited experience and limited voice. However, in the talented young directors, even if they wear paper shackles, there is still room for individual creation. As long as you have a desire to create undue pleasure, for example, before the young directors passed the &quot;Watcher: Sin and Lost&quot; and &quot;The Whole People&quot; Witnessing, as well as the efforts of the young director Cheng Er through the &quot;Borders of the Borders&quot; on the confusing and style of criminal films, can be encouraged and learned. The &quot;Hunter&quot; written by Fuxi, a young director, has the same pursuit. Although it has been mixed, it is worthy of serious consideration. &quot;Hunting the ugly&quot; also chose to use the &quot;criminal people&quot; Wu Zhenyu and Fan Shaohuang as the protagonists of the film, and put the social justice forces such as the public prosecution law into the background or simply let them absent, &quot;covering the traditional story of punishing evil and promoting goodness.&quot; Underneath, focus on the struggle and redemption of humanity in the face of good and evil choices, as well as the discussion of the extent to which violence against violence is justified. The author&#39;s intentions in the type breakthrough are obvious, and the knitting in the drama has also made a lot of effort. The efforts in creating the style of the film are also easily felt by ordinary audiences. The portrait of Hong Kong&#39;s famous photographer, Huang Yuetai, makes the film&#39;s stylization in the language of the film especially prominent. The color, composition and image are all in the face of a strong black movie atmosphere, and the plot and editing rhythm of the first half of the film. This kind of atmosphere combines to complement each other, creating a rare sense of &quot;sin heaven&quot; in domestic movies.: The world of ecstasy, the extravagance of the gangsters, the flirtation of the villains, and the sculpt of the two bosses (Chang Yi and Lin Xue), which brings a sense of Hong Kong gangsters. It is quite fresh in mainland movies. ), the deity of the protagonist and the desire to stop (Wu Zhenyu&#39;s role setting, the director clearly pays tribute to Martin Scorsese&#39;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, similar to Huang Qiusheng in the Hong Kong film &quot;The Taxi Judge&quot;) They all feel quite fresh and energetic, and bring a strong desire to watch. Stylized creation and deepening is not only the effort of image modeling, but also the relay of character characterization and plot development. However, when the relationship between characters becomes clearer, the drama in the latter part of the film gradually disappears. It must be said that it is a bit regrettable. . Moreover, the rhythm of Wu Zhenyu and Fan Shaohuang&#39;s relationship changes is a bit rough, lacking memorable details and human struggles. In addition, how to balance the relationship between the plot advancement, the truth, and the character portrayal is the part of the film writer&#39;s director who wants to learn from the director of &quot;The National Witness&quot;. However, what is more rare is that the suspense of the truth of the relationship between the two is still preserved until the last moment, and the truth of the two people&#39;s behavior is not lacking in touching human brilliance. It must be said that this is in line with the rules and regulations of the film review, and it is also a certain necessity for the development of character. How to effectively combine the two is a category that the young creators of the Mainland will continue to ponder in the future. In addition, although the film&#39;s sub-line story is not much inked, it has effectively compensated for the protagonist&#39;s living space and spiritual world. The relationship between Fan Shaohuang and his father, the love story of Deng Ziyi and Wu Zhenyu all make people feel the true feelings and human salvation beyond the dark atmosphere. It can be said that the film conveys the positive energy of â€œgrounding gasâ€ inadvertently.",movie
566,"Inscription: Entrique, you don&#39;t realize that when you use the &quot;big bang&quot; to call the only beauty, and when you talk like her telepathy, you naturally resolve the loneliness. Although others seem to be, you and the word loneliness are separated by a hundred thousand miles. I think, precisely because you are not standing on the opposite side of the loneliness, this train is no longer called the loneliness. Unique beauty means â€œlonely beautyâ€. She is a beautiful woman, but also a beautiful woman who is lonely and beautiful. This kind of loneliness is not seen in daily life (the kind of loneliness is often the second attribute attached to the beauty, the alienation caused by excessive intelligence and high introspection); the unique loneliness is the defense against strong injury. The mechanism, her eyes are always reminiscent of the little beast that was scared and hunched after the gunshot. Needless to say, such a small beast hides in every corner of our urban forest, and the wounds that cannot be healed all the time. Injury, who has never met? After an injury, I feel that there may be good people in this world. After two injuries, I think that since there are not many good people, I still only believe in friends. One day, after being hurt by the only friend, I thought for a long time: &quot;Is it better to be with myself in this life?&quot;? Although such arguments are too arbitrary, no one can say that it is unreasonable. &quot;Do you really deal with anyone? Anyone else thinks that I am a geek? How can you spend the tens of thousands of steps in the eyes of others and the eyes that are not blinking? In the final analysis, people are group animals...&quot; This kind of hesitation is not without it, but the most rational choice is of course to avoid the possible harm. Fortunately, she is just like this. From this moment on, people talked about her and couldn&#39;t help but frown. &quot;Hey, what are you talking about, the woman who made that kind/thing/love, and now doesn&#39;t talk to anyone?&quot; Is it not our best to judge without thinking? So after graduation, the beautiful and beautifully moved into his own residence, looking for a job that does not need to take a class, and went out to purchase some necessities of life, and ridiculed &quot;the big hidden in the city.&quot; Over time, I even feel that this kind of life is also very delicious. Of course, occasionally, only occasionally, she will also open the travel channel to see the churches in Europe and the grasslands of Africa. &quot;Since people say that there is always a heart and body on the road, let the heart keep on the road,&quot; she thought. But she is not afraid of love.She saw the boy who was warm in the autumn on the bench in the park. The boy took a stray dog â€‹â€‹back home. The girl who watched all of this silently felt the beating of the heart. This is a nameless feeling. She can only call it love. The girl returned home and opened the curtains to find that the boy actually lived opposite him. The distance between the two buildings was so close that they even heard each other. So the &quot;peeping&quot; boy&#39;s life became her daily work. This love is the purest unrequited love. &quot;Everything is my own game, starting from myself and ending by myself.&quot; This decisive attitude makes people sigh. After all, how many people can resist holding the window paper? At the same time, her guest next door is also suffering from lonely love. The skillful painter, day after day, put a comic note on the beautiful milk box, and his love is also so cautious. You love him, I love you?? It is &quot;Mingyue decorates your window, you decorate other people&#39;s dreams.&quot; Life follows Newton&#39;s law and has its own inertia. When loneliness is like a group of fast-moving trains moving fast, can you imagine, what kind of power can stop it, and at the same time it will not be destroyed by collision? I have guessed with the greatest goodwill, and what you think in your heart is: &quot;I can&#39;t catch your dodging eyes, can&#39;t open your tight mouth, I can&#39;t change your loneliness.&quot; ... This is true, it is not an excuse. However, why can&#39;t it be changed? It is precisely because you have a heart that changes loneliness. You stand in front of the oneness, as if you and she are totally incompatible, as if there is no fear in your heart, no hate, as if you have never set foot on a lonely train. Is it hard that you really can&#39;t understand what loneliness is? You have to admit that loneliness can&#39;t be avoided. Once you have a self, you will have loneliness. After all, we can&#39;t do what the cartoon says, melting people on the earth into a sea. However, Entrique, the hero of the story, congratulations, you have boarded the lonely train from the very beginning. Like Jack and Rose in Titanic, the story happens because they are in the same scene. Entrique, you don&#39;t realize that when you use the &quot;big bang&quot; to call the only beauty, and when you talk like her telepathy, you naturally resolve the loneliness. Although others seem to be, you and the word lonely, separated by 100,000Eight thousand miles. I think, precisely because you are not standing on the opposite side of the loneliness, this train is no longer called the loneliness. There is no cure for loneliness because we can never get rid of loneliness. Fortunately, we can forget to be alone because of the connection with others. The picture that impressed me the most, of course, there was a kiss between the beautiful and the little nephew, but I still remember the smiles of the Japanese chefs who gathered in the 403 room. How can we still think of loneliness when people get together and show the softest and softest side to each other? These touches have brought together courage and motivation to let the single beauty out of its own small world. Just as the single beauty experienced a rational judgment and closed itself, she went through a rational judgment and went to the crowd. I know that the world outside is very sinister, but the world outside is love. I found myself being moved by love and moved because I loved others. Be alone is a clever girl. Of course, we would like to thank the little nephew for her persistence and the efforts of the supporting actors to burn life. Because most of the high-end Americans in this world will not have such good luck.",movie
567,"My family is in the northeast, not far from the emperor, but I havenâ€™t been able to go to Deyun to see it. I can see the style of Qiangâ€™s, and I can only sit on the stool and look at the screen frame in front of me. Listen to Qiange and Gang brother&#39;s cross talk, haha â€‹â€‹laughed. Hold in the hand, the frame of the local gold, a man in the horse, holding a bird cage in his hand. The ivy climbing along the wall, a fan of Jingmenâ€™s stubborn, is in front of my eyes. The title of the book &quot;Playing&quot;, Qiange &quot;playing&quot; must be very suspicious, otherwise, will not &quot;play&quot; to the stage, with Guo Degang &quot;comfort&quot;. There must be a little home in the hand, and it is worth shaking. Qiang said that the things that children play now are too boring, and there is no interest at all. Computer games, in addition to hurting the eyes, pass the time, lonely and oppressed, can no longer find a little fun. For Qiangge, &quot;playing&quot; must be, play out the technology, play the level, and have fun. In a nutshell, Qiang did not deliberately insist on the purpose of playing, but in the play, he harvested a lot of unexpected things, friendship, affection, and neighboring feelings. The biggest feature is that Qiangge is a living creature, not a gasping creature, and Qiang has no feeling. Ken can be a man of temperament, something that is mad, and let Qiang feel depressed and exhausted. Playing the birds is the circle where Qiangge first entered. During the process of playing birds, jokes continued. In order to clean the cage for the birds, the eyes of the eyes were successfully escaped from the fingers, and the songs screamed at the treetops, which disturbed the good intentions of Qiange. The eye-catching waiting show was returned to the cage. For four or five hours, I just relied on it. When the flowers thanked me, the modest brother was disheartened. The show was hungry and went into the humble brother and the donkey. The trap basket, the hanging heart, finally landed. The doorway of Qiangeâ€™s playful birds is getting more and more mastery, and the training of the birds is also unambiguous. The birds that arrive at it will be able to pick up things, eat flying food, open boxes and so on for three or five days. Qiang has become a senior bird trainer. Itâ€™s inevitable that the United States and the United States will walk in the city of Birds and show off. Humble brothers have a set of their own path, and there are ways to catch birds. Qiang and three buddies went into the mountains to catch birds, fish, eat, and release. The good things that are not happy, dilute all the troubles. A rewarding day, capturing hundreds of birds. If you put it in the present, Qiangge can catch birds with others. Once you find out, it is inevitable that you will be in prison. At that time, Qiang can only play with his little bird. Whether the bird catching is good or not, whether it promotes the breeding and evolution of birds, it is not known, but if the birds are locked in cagesIn the case of watching people, it is a bit lonely and self-rewarding. Birdie Qiang is tired of playing. It doesn&#39;t take long for him to start playing with pigeons. Choosing pigeons, raising pigeons, and training pigeons will be a little bit lost, which will affect the purity of pigeons and the quality of pigeons. As the old saying goes, there is money without money, and itâ€™s not worth mentioning. Humble brother likes the birds with hair, loves them, likes them, how to get it, no way. Qiang brothers play the birds, not just play, take a look at the flowers, Qian Ge wants to play some doorways and famous halls. Not long after the pigeons were domesticated, the eagle in the hands of the friends, so that Qiange began to think again, the raptors are still a little uncomfortable for Qiang, and dare not easily get involved. After seeing the Hawks and Rabbits, Qiange has more on the birds. In-depth understanding, and then talk about domestication problems, the head is the road. Keeping dogs, raising horses, and raising more and more animals, Qiang is a little restless, looking for empty fields and building sheds. The painstaking hobby, the long-lasting &quot;playing&quot; heart, actually made the future industry, and Qiange gradually stepped into the &quot;playing&quot; family. Play the high-end atmosphere and step by step to the top of the local road. Poor play has a lot of fun, rich play has a rich play. Under the rich and the poor, there is no essential difference, and it is the best explanation for playing. The play of Qiangge is intentionally or unintentionally beaten, and it is also the inevitable result of interest. Without diamonds, you can&#39;t stop the porcelain. Qianqian is playing a bird, playing a kind of way, knowing what to give up, what to give up, what is what you want, the most important, know how to play, make yourself happy, not hurt bone. Don&#39;t say anything about playing things, people who walk deep will not lose their intelligence because they play, but the more they play, the higher their IQ. Still groaning, hurry, play the rhythm, walk up~",movie
568,"&quot;Stalingrad&quot; is an important historical theme and has created a box office myth in Russia. I was expected early. In the positive film, the technical level, audio-visual effects, and computer technology are all high-quality. They are embellished with the tenderness of Russian and German soldiers, making a male war film more cruel. But the director of Fyodor Bundarchuk, who directed the &quot;Ninth Commando&quot; &quot;Crossing the FireWire&quot;, was too old-fashioned. &quot;Stalin&quot; 3D is fake, a bit dragged, and a bit heavy, more like &quot;Jinling Thirteen&quot; by the &quot;Tangshan Earthquake&quot; technique. Although the new version of Stalin has battles of large scenes such as landing warfare, aircraft bombing, continuous artillery fire, and tank attack, it is mainly concentrated in the &quot;Pavlov Building&quot;. The whole small-scale operation begins with a focus on five identities and different backgrounds. The pure love of a Soviet soldier and a little girl, and the &quot;Stockholm-style&quot; tragedy love between the German senior military officer and the Russian lost young woman, as the finishing touch of the enemy. This is to write emotions, because it is necessary to highlight the cruelty of war, and to tell the flash of humanity from different angles, the starting point is good. In the previous section of the relationship, the five soldiers were no longer fighting for the national profits. They had an affection for meeting the 19-year-old girl I saw. In a sense, it is more like to protect the little princess in the attic. Especially the little girl had a birthday scene, someone sang and blessed, someone sent the bathtub (so let the girl take a bath), someone took her to the next door to enjoy the night, all sent a shock in the war, and passed the warmth. Affection. Then the &quot;Stergermo Love&quot; was worse than the ignition. The two men were in the language of their respective nationalities. From the violation of occupation to the relatives and foam, it was still a little deliberate and dog blood. In the end, Russian girls were sneaked and killed by snipers. Because the paving was not concealed, the same lyric effect was not as expected, and it was doomed to cause controversy. In the photography of &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, at first, the pursuit of rich colors and gorgeous looks like oil paintings, but the scenes of war ruins in the back are still the real &quot;dirty mess&quot; of &quot;Fame Name&quot; and &quot;1942&quot;, plus poetic The slow narrative rhythm makes people look heavy and depressed. Of course, the details of the local war in Stalingrad are still amazing. For example, the flame ejector has been fired, and countless fires have been rushing forward. It is very horrifying and cautious; and if the sniper retaliates against the Germans violently, the indecent deaths of those innocent lives make people look chilling. Many Russian soldiers who pretend to have dead blood on their faces, suddenly attacked and killed the Germans, and the German chiefWhen I was killed, I just continued to say that I was very itchy, because the scorpion harassment, this bloody cruel feeling, makes people chilling. This is a war epic film that favors literature and art. It is very restrained from human despair and tragic death and injury. From the plot, production to character portrayal, it highlights the high standard of Russian film. The film is built with the IMAX+3D system, although the scene is huge and large, suitable for IMAX room viewing, but the 3D effect is really flattering, except that the dust is a bit stereoscopic, black and lacquered, eyes are watching It is also very undesirable to get tired. Personally, everyone is looking down on seeing &quot;Stalingrad&quot; because he can&#39;t be as classic as &quot;Save Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Black Hawk&quot;, but its subtle details and human touch can&#39;t be worth only 4.4 points for IMDB. !",movie
569,"The most intriguing part of this book is the introduction of three different memorial halls in Japan. One is the Yasukuni Shrine, the other is the International Peace Museum, and the other is the Kamikaze Special Forces Peace Memorial Hall. The three memorial halls are different. The theme can give a glimpse of Japan&#39;s national outlook. In 1869, Emperor Meiji founded the &quot;Tokyo Soul Society&quot; to commemorate the war dead who helped him establish the Meiji government. In 1879, he officially changed its name to &quot;Jingguo Shrine.&quot; To date, more than 2.46 million soldiers who have died in previous wars have been called to be worshipped by the &quot;British Spirit&quot;, more than 80% of which were killed in the Second World War. Their names are precisely personal here. Among them, one of the main decision-makers of the war of aggression against China and the Pacific War, Dongji Yingji, the main criminal of the Nanjing Massacre, Matsui Shigen, and so on. The Yasukuni Shrine is open to the public free of charge. The number of visitors per year is over one million (more than 5 million in 2007), and the main age of visitors is mainly young. One of the parts of the Yasukuni Shrine is &quot;On the Pavilion&quot;, which displays all kinds of objects related to war. There are war weapons, suicide notes of Japanese soldiers, relics, photographs, and film and television works related to war. The documentary that was broadcasted called Japanâ€™s war of aggression against China a â€œbranch caseâ€ and called the Pacific War launched by Japan â€œself-defense warâ€. In addition to the Yasukuni Shrine in Japan, there are many shrines with different commemorative contents. Two of them are very representative. It is also mentioned in this book that the balance of news is very good. At the Ritsumei University in Kyoto, Japan, there is an International Peace Museum, which opened in 1992. It collected and compiled many war crimes committed by the Japanese army during World War II, such as photos of the Japanese army&#39;s bacteriological warfare and poisonous gas warfare, information on forced levies, and evidence of sexual slavery and sexual violence committed by Japanese troops to Chinese women. There are seven-three-one corps to introduce the live-action experiment, the original bacteriological warfare, the record of slaving Chinese laborers to Japan, and the photos of the Nanjing Massacre. The number of visitors to the International Peace Museum is far less than that of the Yasukuni Shrine, but Japan allows such a presence. I think this is a symbol of social inclusion of multiculturalism and openness. There is also a â€œKamikaze Special Forces Peace Hallâ€ in Kagoshima in the south of Japan. In 1944, the year before the end of the Second World War, the war situation against Japan.More and more unfavorable, especially in the battlefield of the Pacific Naval Battle, the Japanese army was repeatedly frustrated. In order to prevent the US military from attacking at sea, in October of that year, Japan established 8 Kamikaze special forces, recruiting thousands of Japanese youth to become members of the Kamikaze special attack team. More than 9,000 Kamikaze attack aircraft, using suicide attacks that directly hit US aircraft and warships, use this crazy and desperate battle to block the Allied attack and loyalty to the Japanese Emperor. The &quot;Shenfeng Special Forces Peace Hall&quot; shows another face that is different from the Yasukuni Shrine and the International Peace Museum.",movie

I still remember that in the wedding car that was turned over, Ma Yong told Yu Xiaohong that the place we were in was the church. I promised you that one day I will return you a longing for the wedding, ok? However, this initial promise and dream was lost to the boring and complaining life. All the romance disappeared with time. Xiaohong complained that Ma Yong would never accompany her to go shopping. Ma Yong complained that Xiaohong was working hard and she was not considerate. This is actually the way that most of the marriage life will pass, but some people persist in it, support each other, re-love, and some choose to give up.

572,"Domestic crime films have always existed in the mainland movie market. Many filmmakers have tried hard to shoot this type of film, but in the absence of good scripts, especially the limitations of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, The final product is basically a disappointment. In the past two years, the review of the General Administration has made historical changes in many types of films, and the crime films are no exception. The &quot;Guide to the Whole People&quot; was an example in the past, and the &quot;uniform&quot; that is being shown is building. Sexuality broke the bottleneck of the development of domestic crime films. The scale of &quot;Uniform&quot; is the biggest and most challenging in the history of domestic crime films: the film is full of the aesthetics of murder from beginning to end, the bloody scene of tracking, killing, ill-treatment, death, naked body, uniform COS erotic COSPLAY The pictures, as well as the savage and ferocious weapons such as drugs, bayonet, and speed chillers, make people fear and make people swell. The plot of &quot;uniform&quot; is the most reasonable and most chewy in domestic crime films. The whole story is very rigorous, and it is fully prepared to talk about suspense stories with emphasis on taste. In front of the patience and patience of the paving, all kinds of seemingly unintentional details have a role in the final stream, and the case is wonderful and needle-punched. The stimuli have a unique taste of American drama; the characters of &quot;Uniform&quot; are the most full and most individual in the domestic crime film: whether it is the police officer&#39;s old police officer Ren Dahua and his assistant Yinger, Yuan Hong, or the criminal party&#39;s Chen Sicheng and Wu Yue Or Xu Ruo and Li Ai of the victims, each character has a unique character, which gives the soul and emotions Made the plot forward while such careful characterization, it is not easy. The protagonist in the film was bullied by a group of wealthy girls during school, leading to the malignant consequences of handicap, disability and heartache. A few years later, in order to avenge those who had hurt him, they used all cruel means to kill them. Ironically, they dressed up their bodies after they were killed to play with them. The plot is not complicated, the murderous retaliatory serial commits the crime, and the police finally thrilled to detect the case. However, the highlight of &quot;The Uniform&quot; lies in the killings that have been neglected and simplified in many crime films. The murderers in the film did not take the quick murder and deal with the instant combat methods of destroying the dead. Generally adjust, please, play, abuse, and then carry out a ferocious killing, then pluck the body to make up, put on a well-prepared uniform, and finallyPlaced in a public place that matches the uniform. The heavy taste of the Vengeful Killer makes the plot and picture of the film have a unique impact, and it has unprecedented challenges to the audience&#39;s psychology and vision. The murdererâ€™s orderly, calm and chilly state is more frightening and fearful than the seemingly murderous killer on the surface. He is insulting the victimâ€™s inhuman insult and the destructive injury from the flesh to the spirit. Calm, unconstrained, and all this stems from the pain he once suffered, and his heart has long been blinded by resentment and revenge. In his mind at this time, everything he does seems to be taken for granted, karma, this is the most direct and most distorting reaction of a person after being mentally devastated, when you are disgusted and hated by his perversion You will feel how terrible humanity is in the direction of evil. From the storyline of the film and the theme to be expressed, we can think of many social realities in the past years. Those real events that have been insulted, crowded, scorned and played with extremes, have appeared in front of themselves. Don&#39;t ignore the dignity of others, don&#39;t trample on the kindness and trust of others, don&#39;t easily hurt others&#39; hesitation... This is the most direct reminder of the film, and the value and significance of the film. The depth of &quot;uniform&quot; allows the viewer to dig out a lot of truths from different angles, whether it is the expression of Ren Dahua&#39;s duty in police uniforms, or the uniform of the victim&#39;s nurse, Loli, stewardess, and student uniforms. Or the discussion of the good and evil of human nature in the body of the body, &quot;uniform&quot; from the appearance to the core, from the direct meaning to the mapping, have a rich connotation story. Bloody, suspenseful, horrified, reasoning, fighting, the whole rhythm of &quot;uniform&quot; is very good, step by step to reveal the mysterious veil, let you observe, figure out, analyze, speculate, heavy The plot of the taste is ups and downs and well-founded. Every detail in the film is not wasted. Every meticulousness is finally picked up. For example, Xu Ruo? The small details that did not support the antique but the ladder were actually suspended. There is another secret that is sinister, which also makes the film continue to bring unexpected surprises to the audience in the last ten minutes. I really like this kind of film with large scale and heavy taste. The sounding is not smooth, the water is not leaking, and the overall logic is also very good. I did not expect such an ending, and in addition to the accident, there is a sigh for human nature! Such a film is absolutely qualified to let you into the theater.",movie

Long Fei silently paid for her, has been in vain, because in the same way, he loves her, but she does not love him. Therefore, objectively, Luo Weixin and Yao Wenying can not walk together because of the fault of love and being loved. Similarly, Yao Wenying and Long Fei should only be good buddies forever. However, Yao Wenying has paid too much love in these years. When he is tired and wants to stop, there is a silent companion who rushes up to help, and that kind of feeling is enough to melt her, because Yao Wenying is a woman after all. Woman, who is not more willing to be the one who is loved? Even if that is not your favorite, he can at least give you happiness. It is often said that the final one is not necessarily the one who loves the most, but it does not mean that it is not far away. Time can kill one.The same feelings can also cultivate true love, what will happen after that, who knows?

577,"I don&#39;t know if I should be lucky, or if I want to tremble, China has even produced a crime film full of murder aesthetics, that is, the &quot;uniform&quot; currently released. The story is not complicated. A mysterious serial killer commits crimes and is detected. The motive for committing crimes is not complicated. Typical retaliation, but the process of committing crimes is complicated, it is ambush, it is sneak attack, it is looting, and it is anesthesia. It is also changing clothes, freezing, killing, makeup, and styling. All of this gives the victim a different brilliance when it is discovered. The film &quot;Uniforms&quot; dedicates a long-lost, killing criminals with the most sincerity. The whole process of committing crimes, like creating a piece of art, is meticulous and seamless, and ultimately presents an unparalleled &quot;death beauty.&quot; There are many Hollywood-related exquisite crimes. Whether it is the Silent Lamb or the Seven Deadly Sins, criminals are showing off the beauty of the world or the sense of ritual through the art of death. &quot;Uniform&quot; is no exception, and even counts the precedent of domestic films. Related stories, the battle platform is not willing to spoil too much, similar to this suspense and horror film, often the last moment of the truth, after the spoiler, simply can not see. Under the premise of not spoiling, I really want to say that this film tastes very heavy. Just look at the title and the poster, there is a sense of first impression. This is a &quot;uniform&quot; of the three-language, which is the &quot;uniform&quot; of people. It is also a COS full of Japanese &quot;Meng Chong&quot; style, and a little deeper, a SM taste is coming. Looking through the film, all three aspects are considered relevant. Similar to the Japanese and Korean thriller, &quot;Uniform&quot; also promoted COSPLAY&#39;s Kawaii uniform to Everbright, three sets of COS for nurses, princesses and princes, which became the horror clues of the film, the most common thing. Or things, put into the most horrible presentation, with this huge contrast, to impact the psychological defense of the audience, tried and tested. Therefore, when you see that the deceased is tracked, chased, and fascinated by the killer, it is still acceptable. The next killing scene, when the two are actually naked, it is not difficult to produce an indescribable fear, different from the most hurried Buried to kill the murder of the body, &quot;uniform&quot; actually prepared enough time for the killer to bathe, shave, make up, shape, and even hoten the knee with boiling water, so that the already stiff legs can be bent, cut, Isn&#39;t this a typical &quot;love body&quot; movie? So, when you see a girl who has been alive and kicking, suddenly turned into the most beautiful COS, that kind of suffocationThe beauty of the facts, in fact, let them get the peak of a lifetime, although this freeze is also based on suffocation. Of course, if it is a pure criminal process, &quot;uniform&quot; is enough to become a SM-based AV masterpiece, all kinds of limbs, wildness, abuse, killing, and the audience&#39;s eyes wide open. The scale of the film is so astounding, but it has its own value, because in addition to the obvious taste scene, the film also has many aspects such as friendship, affection, love, betrayal, revenge and so on. A descriptive narrative. What is lacking is that the individual sidelines don&#39;t contribute much to the whole film. It&#39;s not a big deal to cut it off. After all, the plot is messy, but considering that many thrillers always create clues to the audience to hint or illusion. Too many double lines exist as normal. &quot;The Uniform&quot; starred by Ren Dahua and Xu Ruo, both of whom are frequent visitors to thrillers and porn, but there is no intersection. This time, together with the crime theme of &quot;Yan corpse&quot;, it really gives a refreshing feeling. . What&#39;s more, there are also wonderful guest appearances of Liu Yiwei, Gao Qunshu, Li Ai, Wu Hao and Ou Di, which are unexpected. It is said that this film was booted in Halloween in 2012. This year, it was released in the 2013 Halloween game. The ghostly temperament is full. The original film name was once named &quot;Devil&#39;s Right Hand&quot;.

579,"When subculture develops to a certain extent, it is naturally easy and graceful to develop some other interesting extensions. Vampire, an image that has been circulated from Eastern Europe and gradually fixed under the influence of American literature and film and television, has gradually faded into a veil, becoming a popular symbol and fixed as a frequent visitor to Halloween. The current popular vampire image originated from the Gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot; published by the Irish writer Bram Stoker in 1897. The author portrays the vampire as a gentleman who is gentle, intelligent, attractive to the opposite sex, and able to control the victim&#39;s mind. In &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;, Dracula became a boss of a hotel (although only open to friends in the fantasy world), commanding zombies and witches to serve strange guests. Character also changed from the legendary heinousness to a little obsessive-compulsive disorder, a bit stubborn, and even a little cute. But more importantly, he is a father and a single father. The film is talking about a matter of trust and communication. Because of this problem, Draculaâ€™s wife indirectly died of fear and angry human offense, and because of this problem, the gentle father, watching her daughter grow up day by day, did not know how to stop her from facing the malicious world. Even after the infatuation of the little &quot;friends&quot; who entered the hotel and his daughter fell in love at first sight, how could he stop it, this cross-domain ethnic relationship that seems destined to be tragic. So the interesting place came out, and the same was the beginning of the main conflict between the two generations. &quot;Floating Story&quot; is a cage that allows Nemo to work hard to break through the goldfish tank, and let his father Marin face up to his own deficiencies and indulge in the pain. In &quot;The Elf Hotel&quot;, the only thing that his father finally realized was that he realized that imprisonment is harm, and deception is destruction. The left hand and the right hand are love, so the climax play is to depict the growth of the vampire father. At the last moment, he risked his life and tried to chase the prospective son-in-law. This is the most touching part of the film, and it is also a new perspective found in this cookie cutter story. What is fatherly love? I don&#39;t think that the child always asks &quot;you don&#39;t want to go anywhere&quot;, but &quot;Daddy doesn&#39;t go anywhere, wait for you to come back.&quot; Of course, in addition to the bottom of this narrative, the main body of the film is a comedy with complete family fun. Inside, let a lot of characters in the terrorist culture take place everywhere.Haoâ€™s gesture appeared. The werewolf is a super madman. The monster in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a warm heart, and the mummy is a fat man who loves to be excited. Most comedy elements don&#39;t rely on people to sell silly to amused, a group of people get together is not a fight or a spit, because the characters have strong characteristics, let them &quot;like people&quot; a contrast is a smile, let them &quot; The reinforcement of the non-human side is also a smile. The rhythm of the movie is very fast, and the songs from the time are also good. Of course, it is not unrelated to the good singing skills of several major voice actors. Andy Samberg finally did not forget that the old bank came to the RAP. Regarding the popularity of vampire culture, the film has made a very vivid reflection on the current real world. Dracula has always remembered the hatred of human beings, so he is determined not to step into this world. The other people in the fantasy world are also. When I heard that someone is there, the first reaction is not disgust or panic. But after a few hundred years, the vampire has become a very cool thing, people are excited to play as monsters to play in the festival. Even a character like Dracula has been established as a totem, and the reason why he is deep in the same level as Ye Gonghao is not to be said. Such a change in the sky for the Dracula party must be mixed. It is precisely because he became a &quot;youth idol&quot; that he can finally complete his task smoothly. In the general trend of 3D, cartoons always have a natural advantage over real films. So in the past few years, even the cartoon 3D effect has made great progress. In addition to the interesting scenery and deliberately emphasized depth of field, &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; has often played Dracula&#39;s horrifying effect on the screen fangs several times.

585,"Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA&#39;s best film, best director and best actor nomination. But most of them come back. It is said that Martin Scorsese found a 1928 non-fiction literature of the same name when he saw the house on a New Year&#39;s Eve in the 1970s. I think that for such a theme, once the old horse sees it, it will never be missed. As a master of the Hollywood gangsters, the era of the gangs in the mid-19th century was of course a long-standing and even fascinating; secondly, he grew up in the small Italian district, against New York. History has always been full of curiosity. It is clear that before the arrival of the Italians, there have been waves of immigrants. Third, the great director loves epic films, putting gang vendettas in the context of national history, gangster films. Sublimation depends on it! However, the old horse of the year was still a fledgling little horse, coupled with the fiasco of the box office of the epic film &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate&quot;, which made the major companies discouraged. This is 20 years, when Robert De Niro is old, he is in the Harvey Weinstein headquarters of Miramax, New York, and has spent a total of 80 million budget. The old horse enabled the iconic star Leonardo DiCaprio, who had already been popular all over the world. So the little plum took the gun of De Niro and became the No. 1 actor in the old horse. There are prototypes for several major characters and events in the film. For example, the â€œlocal gangâ€ comes from the Bowery Boys gang, but the butcher Bill is its member William Poole, who is also the â€œnothing to knowâ€ movement against Irish Catholic immigrants. When its members are asked about their actions, they will answer one of the leaders &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;). The big hits in the opening of the film may come from the bloody battle of Bowery Boys and the Dead Rabbit in 1857 at Five Points, but the time was greatly advanced. At the end of the two gangs, the duel was certainly a fabrication, but the urban riots encountered were genuine. It was the New York City draft riots from July 13 to 16, 1863. Due to dissatisfaction with the payment of 300 US dollars, the policy of military service can be exempted. On the day of the execution of Lincolnâ€™s conscription order, a large number of low-income people attacked the conscription headquarters and burned the house.At the same time, some white laborers took the opportunity to attack the black people and their shops because of their dissatisfaction with the black people entering the labor market after the liberation, which further escalated the conflict. The government finally used the army to suppress the riots, but in the four days it has caused at least hundreds of deaths (mostly blacks) and thousands of people were injured. The disaster is still the most serious public riot in American history, and this film is one of the few movies that responded to the incident. Returning to this film, the prince&#39;s revenge of the father&#39;s father is somewhat old-fashioned and far-fetched, but the director&#39;s cleverness lies in putting it in the context of the pain of national integration and the torrent of urban construction, making these private individuals The gang of gangs is ridiculous and tragic. When the two gangs held a knife and axe to the police and the bullets, when the two bosses were still slammed by the cannons, the dead people were covered with cloth and the candles provided by the municipal government were provided. The cemetery gradually grew up with weeds overlooking the high-rise buildings that rise across the ground. The narration throughout the film rang again: What is it all for? Who will remember them? Big scenes, big productions, and many stars, the epic temperament of this film is beyond doubt. The crew rebuilt the five blocks of Lower Manhattan in Rome&#39;s studio, and invited historians, technical consultants, boxing coaches, dialect teachers, and even Italian thieves to guide the film and actors. The configuration is reflected in everything. Up to 10 Oscar nominations and 12 BAFTA nominations. However, this time, the old horse seems to be a bit too hard, making the theme under the gorgeous appearance seem eager to achieve, especially the interpretation of the historical background and the story line is a bit out of touch. It is said that the first version of the film is one hour longer than the current 166 minutes, and perhaps there is a complete epic classic. However, such a length is obviously unacceptable to the issuing company. The final compromise of the old horse left a regret. I wonder if Weinstein regrets the result of the final award. (Oscar nominations for 10 nominations, no. two)? After performing &quot;The Boxer&quot; in 1997, Daniel Day-Lewis sneaked into Florence to learn shoes for several years. This time, returning to the big screen, the British film actor who adhered to the method of performance, after training with the world boxing champion last time, this time he went to the butcher to learn the slaughtering technique. He has been insisting on a New York accent for more than 100 days in the filming process, and even refused to see a doctor after being diagnosed with pneumonia.Historical conditions. He holds Irish nationality and he hates Irish immigrants in the film. When a flying knife hits the portrait of Lincoln, he later played Lincoln to get the film. His dedication of the big villain overshadowed the balance of all the other Kass, Oscar lost to the youngest Adrien Brody is an accident, otherwise he can complete the shadow hat trick earlier.",movie
586,"Shortly after the film began, a corpse case occurred. The billionaire sister was murdered inexplicably, and she was wearing an old-fashioned nurse&#39;s costume and was smeared with heavy makeup. Such a strange killing technique made the police very surprised, and another another happened. The murder case of the rich sister, and the deceased is also the old-fashioned princess costume, which is also smeared with heavy makeup, and the technique is similar. So who is the next unfortunate? The murderous performance is very peculiar, and this is also a very similar performance of crime films in recent years, full of mysterious and horrible atmosphere. There is no doubt that the killer is not for money, but for the socialites, this is love killing or homicide, suspense clumps, so that the audience is full of curiosity. The film writer seems to be painstaking, otherwise it would be so chilling to spread the crimes and murders of college students. Thanks to the roommate&#39;s non-killing body may become a joke, but the mental health disease of college students or middle school students can not be relieved. The gap between the rich and the poor, casual jokes may cause relatively psychologically inferior students to bury the fire of revenge. And the film is such a story. The film tells the story of a killer and three rich girls. It has a relationship with beautiful women. Naturally, it is very heavy. The camera has some naked and bloody shots. In particular, Chen Sichengâ€™s acting killer is good at using frozen means to kill people invisibly. Cruel. The technique and the Silent Lamb have a certain resemblance. Of course, this perverted killer played by Chen Sicheng is also very dedicated, and his face is enthusiasm, but in fact he hides the unfathomable insider. The film is produced by Hong Kong&#39;s great director Wang Jing. Naturally, these films have contributed to the creation of heavy-duty lenses. However, in view of the electric audit system, there may be many large-scale shots of the film being deleted, and the criminals are smashing the beautiful bodies. Some of the shots are also point to date. A joke triggers a man&#39;s physical and mental wounds. It may be the real reason for the criminals to slay and kill. It is because the jokes of the three beautiful women lead to the loss of the function of the males who have opened their hearts, and their right hands are also unconscious, and the beautiful women lie. It was the boyâ€™s dismissal and was expelled from school. Many incentives led to male mad revenge. In the process of revenge, the boy found that his paralyzed nerves began to recover consciousness, but the recovery of all instincts was meaningless to him. It is clear that I am getting a thrill in revenge, which is enough to show that the criminal mentality has been severely abnormal. The concept of film publicity is between good and evil. The left hand of the angel is the right hand of the devil. The insured of Chen Sicheng runs to the public security bureau to promote sales.Insurance itself is not reliable, it is obvious that he is going to the police station to observe the words, of course, all of this is seen by the police who are ill-conceived. Like many students&#39; criminal cases, because of their inferiority, the psychological pressure is too heavy, and there are their own reasons plus external attacks. The insurgentsâ€™ murders can be analyzed, and the mental illness is small, and their own great future is abolished. The big one leads to murder. In fact, personal poverty can be compensated by relying on hard work, but the insurer blames a few rich girls for their failed life. The hatred of hatred has evolved into a crime, and such tragedy is very educational. Once the demons are resurrected, control is difficult. The plot of the film is still good. Of course, the biggest highlight of the film is that the case is the victim and the real murderer who killed Luo Zihan. This is too urgent, which makes the audience very surprised. Of course, the analysis is later. That&#39;s right, but adding one stroke, although it may be a lot of color, but the complete performance of the whole film is somewhat self-defeating. In fact, you can grasp the motivation of students&#39; psychological crimes to do their homework, but the film seems to be more in order to win the audience&#39;s curiosity, and lose the film&#39;s deep connotation processing opportunities. Just like the title &quot;uniform&quot;, don&#39;t run the question, it&#39;s counterproductive. The film&#39;s overall feelings and non-line &quot;Stalker&#39;s Sinister Loss&quot; are somewhat similar, and the deep crime film is still the goal of the filmmakers, although the film has certain merits.

The film is starred by a circle of idol stars and comedy stars. The distinctive actor image fits well with the character, making it easy for people to enter the story. In a few pairs of main characters, individuals I think the most interesting one is the couple combination of Mango Taiwanese mouth Du Haitao and Taiwanese performance genius Hold sister Xie Yilin. The two common characters with the same shortcomings and advantages are the most resonating. One is the best of one penny and eight petals. Tuen Mun, the name and price of all the discounted items in the mall, I am reluctant to invite girls to eat each time, with a homemade bean bag and sushi in the lunch box, and another Oscar daydream, but even one Female students who are not recruited by members of the drama community can only rely on the free marriage of the helpers to accumulate performance experience and creative materials. When the men of the Tuen Mun encounter the unrestrained female, the contrast of personality is a happy joke. Another pair of Han Xue, the strong woman of Han Xue, and the love of the group&#39;s son, Li Jiahang, are more fashionable and beautiful, revealing the elite love puzzles that are common in the modern workplace. The emotions are inseparable from the spirit and The collision of matter and business. Feng Chaoming&#39;s love for otaku and literary womenLove is another twist and tear with the meaning of fairy tales. Two young people who are ashamed to express themselves in reality, through one after another, gradually realize that the people they love are around. Three groups of completely different types of couples were cleverly mixed together, and various scenes of the blind date were staged. All kinds of wonderful singers appeared in turn. Although they were exaggerated and ridiculous, they could find the source in reality, such as the blind date held by Zhao Dad. At the conference, all kinds of beautiful ladies are just like the draft, just for the prospect of marrying into the giants; like a beautiful woman, she is transformed into five full-type girls, answering the remote control problem of Jiang Xiaoyu&#39;s mother, the vivid change The show is full of different mentality and situation of the leftover women, and Xie Yilinâ€™s talent for playing is fully utilized. Undoubtedly, blind date has become the most common way of love in the current city. &quot;I am a blind date&quot; shows the strange and singular tastes of single men and women in blind date, recording their loneliness and desire. Passion or innocence, although the road to love is infinitely twisted, but through these roles, hope is injected into reality. No matter how many failures and unreliables are blind, as long as you feel with your heart, you can always find the one you love and love you. Come on, let the rest of the people.",movie

590,"The simple Amai is really too innocent. Since some people have argued that he may be undercover in the bodyguard five-person group, there has never been a discussion about the various details of his undercover. At 45 minutes and 43 seconds, the camera switched from Ashin&#39;s car anchor to Amai&#39;s close-up, as if he had just learned an ulterior secret. The voiceover is a weather forecast. Where did the sound of the weather forecast come from? Broadcast in the car. Why does the sound of the car broadcast appear in both scenes at the same time? What does this imply? This case has been completely broken. Many people are very curious about how Amai knows how to swear. Really just guessing? Do not! He has solid evidence. Amai has been monitoring the car that picks up the big man. So he could hear the weather forecast in the car and the sound of the car. However, tonight, let us forget the &quot;Who is Undercover&quot; game, from the perspective of the characters of the Three Kingdoms, re-examine this flamboyant &quot;gun fire&quot;. Why do you think of the Three Kingdoms? Because the role of Wenge is really a home-hearted and too fucking like a super-black boss Liu Bei. And his tiger will be five, if you can&#39;t let you think of the Five Tigers, you can only blame you for being too old (not reading the Three Kingdoms). Guan Yu--A Ghost: The head of the Five Tigers will definitely be that he is right! Zhang Fei--A Fei: Zhang Fei is very fat, and A Fei is also very fat. And fly and fat homonym! So Zhang Fei is A Fei! Zhao Yun--Amai: The five tigers will be inside. Guan Zhang Zhao is the first group of people who followed the uncle. When Wenge met the five-person group, it was obvious that he had been with Wenge before. Fei, Amai three, according to the exclusion method, so Zhao Yun can only be Amai. What&#39;s more, Amy&#39;s character is as stupid as Zhao Yun. Huang Zhong--Alai, Ma Chao--Ashin: Alai and Ashin originally belonged to a group, so they also put it together. In the same way, according to the exclusion method, there is also the generation of Alai is higher than Ashin, so only Alai can play Huang Zhong. In addition, Ma Chao is always worried about the situation of falling off the chain. It is really like Ashin. This pairing rule applies only to the five-person group. If you see that my pairing is cool, I want to match the other important characters in the film. So, in order to be more reasonable, I need to forget all the previous pairings and reset them. Of course, the central spindle does not change. Wenge is still down to earth to be his Sichuan king Liu Bei. A ghost: In fact, the ghost is more like Zhuge (bright), control the overall situation, and strategize. The closest thing to Wenge is him. The most basic thing is him.So he is Zhuge. A Fei: A Fei once followed the ghost, indicating that it is an apprentice of the ghost. In addition, when the second mission, that is, the mall shootout, the Wenge is not protected by the ghost, but is handed over to Afei. Here we can see it as a heritage of Zhuge Yi. So Ah Fei turned out to be Jiang Wei! However, at the end of the game of killing Ashin, A Fei can call back, indicating that his mind is still very meticulous, worthy of the name of Jiang Wei! A Mai: Amai is always Zhao Yun. Because we can&#39;t find a better alternative. Anyway, every time I saw Amai running in the rain of bullets, I would think of the seven-in and seven-outs in Changchunpo, while slashing people and shouting &quot;Wu Nai Changsha Paper Farmers&quot;, Zhao Yun is a courage. Alai: Ala is a bit strange, it seems to be opposite to the ghosts, but often it will be unexpectedly combined, so Alai is the same as the dragon, the Pang Tong. Ashin: A letter slept a lot, a little Wei Yan rebelled. In addition, according to the subtle relationship between the ending Ghost and Ashin, it is also possible to basically conclude that Ashin is Wei Yan. People say that Zhuge will count, and I laugh too much. Where Wei Yan said, as Zhuge said, &quot;the back of the brain has anti-bone.&quot; He has the opposite bone in his name. Wen Hao: When it comes to Ashin, I have to mention it. &quot;Gun Fire&quot; treats the status of women in the same way as &quot;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. The three countries have written thousands of things, but only with dozens of women. &quot;Gun Fire&quot; only arranged the only female character like Daxie. Even the name was too lazy to give her up, and there was almost no line. In the end, because of the slap in the face of the smuggling, let me think of the wife who led the well. Mrs. Qi is very clear about Liu Beiâ€™s character. Even if she is alive and returning, Liu Bei will not let her have a good life after going through the long-distance riding with the uncleâ€™s thousands of miles and the uncleâ€™s long slope. Of course, this is only one of the secondary possibilities. I won&#39;t discuss it in depth here. Fei Xiang: Xiang Shu is looking at Liu Wei, who is taken by Liu Beishun to go to Jiangshan. Who is the country? The guns were flustered. Nan Ge: Because Anan is the real brother who mixes and drinks behind Wenge, and his character is ruthless, so he is Zhang Fei. The killer leader: The last five people killed the hand, and both the enemy and the enemy have heroes. The killer leader and the ghost are like Zhou Yu and Zhuge in Chibi. Finally, the ghost shot at the killer and shot three times, insinuating Zhuge Sanqi Zhou Yu. Ok, today&#39;s broadcast is broadcast here. Below is the weather forecast. If you want to learn the coolest stance, take a look atWu Zhenyu in Gunfire! If you want to stay in the most handsome mid-point, then look at Zhang Yaoyang in &quot;The Gunfire&quot;! If you want to wear the most fashionable glasses, then look at Huang Qiusheng in Gunfire! If you want to eat peanuts very literary, then look at Lin Xue in Gunfire! If you want to take your shirt off sexy, then look at Lu Yuxian in Gunfire! If you are learning Cantonese, but you complain that TVB speaks too slowly and wants to sleep, then Kaohsiung in &quot;The Gunfire&quot; teaches you how to live a prolific continuous reading with three sounds, yang mou ngo, Send a signal that &quot;someone wants to kill me.&quot; If you are still learning to talk about trash, then Ren Dahua in &quot;The Gunfire&quot; teaches you how to make a natural and cold speech every time you turn around. It makes people feel funny and bored. Itâ€™s not boring and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s funny. If you don&#39;t know where to play billiards, don&#39;t know how to play the tower defense, then look at the most classic mall shootout in &quot;The Gunfire&quot;, Du SIR will personally tell you what is the 360 â€‹â€‹degree 0 dead angle. Now, let&#39;s follow the footsteps of A Fei in the long shot and end the show today.",movie

592,"Big, according to Xu Shen&#39;s &quot;Said the text&quot; to explain is &quot;the big man is big, so the elephant is human.&quot; For more than two hundred years of dynasties, there are only a handful of historical figures in the Chinese civilization. Many years ago, Hunan TVâ€™s &quot;Da Ming Dynasty 1566&quot; TV series almost brought the prominent figures of the Ming Dynasty to such as Hai Rui, Jia Jing, Yan Yan, Yan Shizhen, Xu Jie, Gao Gong, Zhang Juzheng, Hu Zongxian, Qi Jiguang, Li Shizhen, etc. all wrapped up a circle, without the two years of the Song Dynasty, because the government was only one-tenth of the two Songs, the emperor Yuguomen, at that time was the Chongzhen rebellion Can escape, or eunuch Wang Chengen back to let him self-hanging Jingshan branches. As for the historical praises of &quot;Jilong Tang and Song Dynasties&quot; and &quot;Yuanmai Hantang&quot; is just a sentence of Comrade Kangxi. If you want to be more true, then Chairman Mao only mentioned &quot;Tang Zongsong&quot; in &quot;Zhuyuan Chunxue&quot;. &quot;Zhu and Qinhuang Hanwu&quot; but there is no &quot;ming&quot;? Let go of the &quot;big&quot;, and then focus on the &quot;robbery&quot; of &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot;. The interpretation of &quot;Said the text&quot; is &quot;people want to go, force to stop, æ›°Robbery.&quot; Letting go of the sinister disasters such as Chen Yuanyuan during the troubled times, it is not only the anti-humanity Zhang Xianzhong who wants to kill the massacre as fun. If it were not for him, there would be no such thing as Huguangâ€™s filling of Sichuan in Chinese history. The theme of the movie is the plague. I think everyone remembers the spring of ten years ago. There was a long-lasting SARS incident in Beijing. Ten years later, I saw many media looking back, looking back and reflecting on everything that SARS brought to us from different perspectives. To understand the current scientific development, in the face of a sudden disease disaster, what we can do is still very limited. I can imagine that the plagues that occurred in the feudal dynasty, not only to wait for a road? In the film, The only remaining soldiers in the Ming Dynasty, they all took their own life and the pharmacy to take Zhao Chuan, so when the soldiers found that the disaster in the military camp could not be controlled, all the exports were left to kill the stubborn The old man who is obsessed with the theory of typhoid fever is in the middle. On the other hand, Wu Youke, who has traveled to the rivers and lakes, has seen too many tragic and desolate scenes of â€œthe loss of thousands of villagers and the sings of thousands of households.â€ He not only healed the thieves of the army, but also healed the imperial court. As a healer, he has always been independent. When he and the master have a pathological dispute, all he can do is to prove the master&#39;s prejudice, stubbornness and mistakes with silent actions. Imagine: the stubborn cost of the master is too great, so that he lost his life. If he can hear the dialectic of dialect, he may notThere is a &quot;robbery&quot; of this movie. From this point of view, I think the first protagonist of this film should be Wu Youke. He is in the spirit of nuances, reflecting not only the comparison with Sun Chuanting who healed the national disaster, but more importantly because of this. The emergence of the plague allowed him and his &quot;plague theory&quot; to be remembered and transmitted by history. Compared with Sun Chuanting, who diagnosed and treated the country as a large body, he is undoubtedly lucky. One leaf boat is exiled to the rivers and lakes, and that is the fate of life. As two real-life Mingshi figures, the director has done a good two-line description and two-line crossover performance, one under the flash, one under the darkroom of the film, and one is the storyboard of the story, one It is the doctors who traveled in the rivers and lakes, and the contradiction between their identity conflicts and their duties and missions brought the most important spiritual core to this film. The worldâ€™s chaos, the high-rise buildings of the Ming Dynasty faced various kinds of invasions of the southeast and northwest winds. The wind, cold, moisture and scorpion venoms were all swallowed in the rodents, and the winds and the cranes were all squad, and several pieces of military documents were needed. How does Song Gaozongâ€™s means of killing Yue Fei have the same effect! Trust, or trust, if there is no cornerstone of trust, even if the general triumphant class, I think in the doubts and speculations of the Ming emperor, his end will not be good. I thought that when I first learned the Chinese class of &quot;Bian é¹Š see Cai Yigong&quot;, when the last sorrow was sore and caused people to squat, he had already escaped from the Qin dynasty, but he could only accept the fate of dying. Who had expected that, after thousands of years, a film released was telling the story of &quot;the cure for the disease has not been cured, and it has not been cured.&quot; Generals and doctors, the state and the people, if they are four independent closed quadrants, then the disease must be their intersection, in front of the disease, in the face of martyrdom, &quot;who is wrong, who is an ordinary thing, but the sword is a home.&quot; &quot;Take out the heart of the country as a worried man, in fact, it also shows the final destination of the general for himself.&quot; I didnâ€™t expect a medical practitioner to be able to understand the truth of the worldâ€™s &quot;the beginning of the dying, the demise of the world and the world&quot;, so it is not difficult to understand and &quot;can not heal a non-drug&quot;. . When in the &quot;disrupted&quot; environment, who had expected a general and a medical doctor, but in the lonely wilderness to show us a parallel and cross-over unique human life questions, it is worthwhile for us to get to know and understand, to understand The micro and macro behind the word &quot;robbery&quot;. Mrs. Sun is like a TV on TV.In the drama &quot;Conquest&quot;, there is no extra words for Hua Qiang&#39;s lover Mei Zi. Some are just the support of eyes and action. In the film &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, Carina Lau is also like Zeng Zhiwei, but she may only be compared to Mrs. Sun and Mei Zi. There is more desire for performance, but that is a little bit more, so the taste is completely gone. In the movie, Mrs. Sun silently guarded everything that feudal women should ask. The husband and wife, the laundry and cooking, are the most important norms in the traditional three-five-five, but when the camera shifts to the moment when the husband rides on the big horse and returns home. I read the unique character and beauty of Mrs. Sun. The master is back, the master is back! This is a surprise for the servant. In contrast, Mrs. Sun, her surprise is expressed and expressed in another form, her manners, her inner smile, perhaps more than one heart. Trembling, yes, the husband came back and returned safely. What I longed for was not a fierce kiss, but a simple smile. The beauty of that moment made me feel that Feng Bo, who plays Mrs. Sun, is awesome. Can you imagine this being the words spoken before the woman puts the dagger in the woman&#39;s throat? When the husband defrauded the trust, he actually stabbed him two times, and the two &quot;masters&quot; made me feel uneasy. Oh, the first cry is so fragile, and the second cry is the same helplessness. On the other hand, the general&#39;s actions and manners are the embodiment of a man&#39;s innate protection of women, so what I see is that the husband loves his wife, but the wife knows the master. Knowing each other, loving each other to know each other, perhaps a knowing word is the true meaning of the ultimate love. I am still thinking silently: Does a woman like Feng Bo have a boyfriend? Is there a marriage?",movie
593,"In 1993, Tim Burton&#39;s animated film &quot;Christmas Night Cry&quot; allowed us to see another possibility of combining horror and humor. It turns out that you can have love, and the Frankenstein bride can have love. Since then, Boltonâ€™s &quot;Zombie Bride&quot; has brought a vigorous love to humans and zombies. This subversive concept also conveys infinite positive energy. So when the Columbia Film Company launched the cartoon &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;, the horror elements that taught people to be scared have finally been completely romanticized, and you will find that Hollywood is omnipotent, including turning Dracula&#39;s gloomy castle into a lively place. Crazy and warm super party. No matter how terrible the identity background of the protagonist, the expression is the theme of &quot;Father loves the mountain.&quot; I have to admit that &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; has almost cut the &quot;emerging point&quot; of all the audience. When the mummies become authentic earthen fat, when the werewolves fall into a helpless middle-aged crisis, when they become couples, when the invisible people are playing treasures, especially the vampires. The earliest ancestor Dracula is still a good-looking father who loves women and refuses to ruin humanity. This play is unique. Of course, whether it is the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; series or &quot;Superman Story&quot;, &quot;Family&quot; and &quot;Caring&quot; are the constant themes of most Hollywood cartoons. &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is undoubtedly a set of &quot;vulgar&quot; models, but Created a good comedy effect. Those spider webs and Hydra have become cute and spleen, almost covering all the inferiority of human beings. When the enchanters have &quot;humanity&quot;, things begin to become funny. I believe that no child can look at such a film and will be afraid of catching his eyes. Especially the most talked about is &quot;love&quot; and &quot;family&quot;. The vampire daughter falls in love with the bridge of human boys. It is like the alternative version of Romeo and Julie. Ye, those seemingly &quot;impossible relationships&quot; are possible in the hands of the dreamer. Therefore, &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; has become more individualized, and even bypassed Burton&#39;s strong personal style, satisfying the commercial appeal while playing a new trick in the details. In the horror film, I sang the protagonist&#39;s monster to find the cute point, becoming the biggest feature of &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;. The hilarious party scene completely reversed our three views. The original monster can also be so human and so crazy. Under the exploration of a human boy&#39;s mistaken collision, the shining of human nature itself has been unearthed. Although it is still &quot;silver teapot, decorated with spiders; hard work, the whole family is afraid of sunrise&quot;, but those plots that exude positive energy, the &quot;knife&quot; dubbed by Adam SandlerThe mouth of the mouth, the heart of the tofu, the legend of the vampire is completely brushed with the intimate pink. The carnival of those &quot;moems&quot; is the most complicated and gorgeous in this simple story, if you are a psychic boy The movie like Norman still has a good impression, so you will definitely like &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;, which is the most typical &quot;love and sincerity&quot; in Hollywood. As the film director Gerndy Tatakowski said: &quot; I don&#39;t want to do real-life characters in the film, but I want to bring that exaggerated style into the film, and then in turn influence the audience&#39;s intuitive and real-world feelings. &quot;So, this horror comedy has become a wonderful look now.&quot;",movie

595,"After reading Murakami Harukiâ€™s &quot;The End of the World and the Cold Wonderland&quot;, I don&#39;t like it very much. It is very puzzled that he has no detailed description of his details. Because that is not even a fine description, but can only be called &quot;display.&quot; I don&#39;t know how the descriptions on these details help the clarity of the mood&#39;s rendering theme. As a reader, why should I care about all the objects in the protagonist&#39;s line of sight and their messy brands? It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t describe it, but that these details should promote the development of the story, or through these details, trap the reader into an emotional trap. However, apart from the details of the last few chapters, the others seem to be inexplicable. Even as a &quot;computer&quot; professional habit, it is not necessary to highlight this trait in all chapters. This is a defect that can be disposed of on a technical level. Moreover, the narcissistic atmosphere revealed in the text is too strong. Fat girl, the library girl at the end of the world, the library girl in the cold reality? In addition to the fat girl who needs to show the &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;straight&quot; individual traits, you can hardly tell the three girls. What is different in personality, the whole story is just a &quot;I&quot; in depression. You can hardly see the emotional interaction between &quot;I&quot; and these girls. All the stories seem to be &quot;I&quot; in my own mind. When &quot;I&quot; needs them, they will Appear in the position that appears, do what you need to do. Then, staying at the end of the world, or returning to the cold reality, it is difficult for both to arouse the resonance of the stress in the reader&#39;s heart. At least for me, neither is much of a attraction. Under the calm lake, there is a dark current, you will feel a strong and unmatched traction in the emotions, let you make the choices in your heart, go forward without any hope. Overall, the idea is very good. Cut off the shadows, dissolve the existence of the heart, spend an endless life without pain or strong happiness at the end of the world built by your own consciousness, or retain the existence of the heart, return to the cold reality, feel every minute The pain of suffering, but also the refreshing joy of every minute and every second? In short, if you want, you can draw a lot from it. However, as a novel, it can only be said that the story is general, the details are tasteless, I have not been hit by one of the points, and I can&#39;t do personal extension from that point. Just like a movie, it uses a very good idea to build the core of the story, but because of the script or the directorâ€™sFor the sake of the story, the story itself is unattractive. After you read it, you are not happy with it, so you can look at other people&#39;s film reviews. After reading it, you seem to understand a lot of meaning. However, it is undeniable that the prose essay passages of the last few chapters are still very good. The excerpts are as follows: &quot;There is a sorrow in the world that cannot shed tears. This sorrow cannot be explained to anyone, even if it is explained. It will always be the same, such as the snowless night snow is quietly deposited in the bottom of my heart. When I was younger, I tried to resort to this kind of sorrow to the language. However, no matter how to search for words, it can not be conveyed to others, or even can not be conveyed to I myself had to give up such efforts. So, I closed my own language and closed my heart. Deep sorrow can&#39;t even be expressed in the form of tears. Care and heart are not the same thing. Care belongs to The independent function, which is more accurate, belongs to the surface function. It is just a habit, different from the heart, the heart is something deeper and stronger, and more contradictory. Once the heart disappears, there is no sense of loss, no disappointment, no loss. The love of the home. The only thing left is life, only a quiet, windless, waveless life. However, there is no competition without no complaints. There is desire, nothing more than saying that there is no opposite thing, that is happiness, ultimate happiness and love. Just because there is despair, disillusionment and sadness, there is joy. There is no desperate happiness that does not exist at all.&quot; Unfortunately, This is a novel, not a collection of essays. Unfortunately.",movie

In my eyes, it shows the jungle bloody battle, the boxing to the flesh and the sex of men and women, and the eroticism claimed by &quot;3D Meat Pouf&quot;, the muscles sold by the &quot;Death Squad&quot; series and even the touchable horror of &quot;3D scorpion&quot;, the essence The same is true. Sensory stimulation and visual impact are the ultimate selling points of such films. Refusing to think and oppose complexity is the gold medal for such movies. From &quot;Fine Dance Gate&quot; to &quot;Seven Little Arhats&quot;, from &quot;No Limits&quot; to &quot;Happy Family&quot; to the &quot;Iron Blood Angel&quot;, I have to admit that the director Fu Huayang&#39;s &quot;no lower limit&quot; of the film is staggering. In the long-term reputation of the work, the box office often does not improve (until the appearance of the shocking 150 million &quot;Happy Family&quot;), like him repeatedly shot (and some shots), stubborn, not Itâ€™s really rare for mainland directors who are not dying to hit the South Wall. Judging from the specific performance of the newly released &quot;99-minute pure sensory blockbuster&quot;, although there are still many old directors&#39; old hobbies and old problems, they are steadily improving their film productions and gradually bringing commercial films to life. The rhythm control and the fighting scenes of Hong Kong&#39;s famous Wuzhi Ma Yucheng&#39;s fancy swords, the old saying of &quot;Being able to make a good job&quot; is really a bit reasonable. The story of &quot;Iron Blood Angel&quot; is super simple, and this is the consistent style of this kind of film: a group of beautiful women who donâ€™t like to wear clothes after entering the depths of the rain forest, and the same team hate to wear clothes but obviously can play the original After the tribe encounters, after the fight, the two sides dismissed the misunderstanding and became friends. At this time, the other team likes to wear clothes but does not like to wear clothes. The face of the grimace is not correct. There are also some abnormal international mercenaries falling from the sky. Called a good fight, straight to kill the sun and the moon, flesh and blood, ghosts crying, big chest tremble...?? Although the film interspersed flashbacks to explain the identity relationship between characters, love and hate, although The male lord and the female lord for a while and for a while, and then reconciled, undulating and climaxing, but obviously these are the condiments and intermissions between the scenes of the battles, the director is not ready to reveal what is &quot;shocking&quot; &quot;Conspiracy&quot; is not prepared to present &quot;the lofty thoughts of universal compassion&quot;, but it is not prepared to carry out &quot;deep dialectical thinking about human nature&quot;.Although he used the Berlin movie, Yu Yu played the female No.1, but he really did not prepare to hit the three major film festivals? In a word, the director is going to shoot a commercial film that rejects depth, does not have to think, and sensationalizes the senses. Ok, this task is actually not too difficult, and he is basically finished. Yu Xue plays the role of Bai Xue (although Yu Yu has never been white), and the eagle played by Zou Zhaolong (will definitely not fly) is the hero of the film. The exquisite acting of the former conquering foreign judges is basically useless here. The test is the skill of her fists and the ability to throw darts. The end of the emotional drama and the tangles of the characters in the film is a piece of cake for her. It is estimated that she is also playing with a holiday mentality, but Can maintain quality and quantity to complete the characters; Zou Zhaolong played countless classic villains, it is rare to play a positive and positive angle, or people are quite surprised, he and the film several men have fierce confrontation, skill is extraordinary, I have to pay attention to my homework and see the tides of people. I can&#39;t help but sigh that Zou Zhaolong is actually in good condition in all aspects. Unfortunately, in the past few decades, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and others who are better than him have been on the top and have not got more and better opportunities. This time, his performance is remarkable. Compared with him, the Japanese actor Mu Xiaolong, who appeared in the &quot;Nanjing Nanjing&quot; Japanese squad officer, still interprets the evil man, but his space is limited, and he has not given him more drama to carry out more black characters. As for An Zhijie, his role in this time accounted for a lot of cheap, but it does not refer to the female oil, but refers to the character set: this person is in a delicate situation, the pressure is big, the character is more rare development variation, and A lot of mastery of the action and the show of the muscles of the handsome male gods, is a particularly easy-going role? If you can arrange a pair of entangled emotional dramas and even passionate dramas with a certain combination of beautiful women, then it is better. . As for Pan Shuangshuang, oh no, it is Pan Shuangshuang, and Hu Mengyuan and other sexy women, their role can be described at a glance, is a man knows. When it comes to other deficiencies, the good guys seem to be a bit amiable, lacking some contradictions and conflicts, and the &quot;desires&quot; of the main characters seem to be inaccurate and persistent, which has led to some sluggishness and aesthetic fatigue in the second half of the film. Of course, according to the strength of Fu Huayangâ€™s director and the filmâ€™s death, I have reason to expect him to do better next. is it possible? I believe that it is ok. (Finish)",movie
598,"Zhao Wenzhuo&#39;s &quot;Su Shier&quot; was defeated at the box office. Some people even asked him to shoot &quot;Da Wudang&quot;, which really admired the investors&#39; eyes. Probably the &quot;Crysis of Far Cry&quot; rotten to the limit, Yang Mi resisted more than 90 million box office, allowing investors to see hope. Thus, &quot;Da Wudang&quot; was born. No one thought that &quot;Da Wudang&quot; was worse than &quot;Su Shier&quot;, and the story was not rolling. The old partner of Yuan Kui and Zhao Wenzhuo actually made such a stupid martial arts design, which made people even more miserable! This kind of rotten man who does not pay for life, lose one is one, pay two more should. In fact, when Zhao Wenzhuo and Donnie Yen clamored for the board, they should reflect on the fragments of their own annual performances! Is it worth the audience? Why are there two Lin Juemin films born in the past two years? Can you win the grand prize with the main melody? &quot;Hundred Years Love Letter&quot; was a fiasco at the box office, but Jiang Mengyu was awarded the Lily Award of the movie channel. Hairun Investmentâ€™s â€œWar with the Wifeâ€ was equally fiasco, with a box office of 140,000. What is the concept of this number? Can the money from the directors of Da Dawei, Xu Qing and Wang Xiaolie earn back? Originally, Dai Dawei and Xu Qingâ€™s sisters and brothers were combined. The heroineâ€™s age was too large and she was not seen by the audience. Wang Xiaolie, the photographer of Yunshuiyu, went through the eyes of modern women and crossed the Republic of China. This way, the idea is good, the story is chaotic, and the word of mouth is gone. Now I talk about why the box office is fiasco with &quot;Wife and Wife&quot;. I don&#39;t think it is just the reason for the failure of word of mouth and actor match. Last year&#39;s May 1st, &quot;Super Battleship&quot; &quot;Titanic&quot; swept, &quot;Golden Robbery&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Killing&quot; are not cheap, if there is no government, who TMD goes to the cinema to remember the revolutionary martyrs? Which theater owner is willing to give a film? 140,000 box office, I think some bosses are big heads! The birth of two vigilant action films, &quot;Inline&quot; and &quot;Fire Dragon&quot;, let Director Lin Chaoxian retrieve the old state. In particular, &quot;Informer&quot; let Nicholas Tse in the Hong Kong Golden Awards, naturally won the &quot;Anti-War&quot; shooting opportunity. . However, investors and editors think that the combination of &quot;Xie Weifeng + Jay Chou&quot; is invincible, thinking that the two brothers are high enough, absolutely more than 200 million in the mainland box office. As a result, this action was a blockbuster movie. The scene was fierce enough. Xie Weifeng jumped from the building and fought hard, but he was desperate enough to win the reputation of many commentators. Jay Chouâ€™s cool performances are the subject of criticism. &quot;Anti-War&quot; claims to invest 200 million yuan, which is purely a boast. But 100 million investment is always there, but the box office is not high enough.The box office has only passed 130 million yuan, Hong Kong has more than 20 million box office, and the world has added more than 200 million box office. It still makes the &quot;war&quot; a bloody situation. &quot;Chunque Terrace&quot; starring Chow Yun-fat, Liu Yifei, Su Youpeng and Qiu Xinzhi wants to copy the global box office miracle of &quot;Golden A&quot; and &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, and invited the Japanese Yumu Hong to help out, but the enemy of the film in the National Day, but the more The more you come. Long shadows and light were not good. Immediately, &quot;Tongquetai&quot; was released in advance, and they rushed to the box office before &quot;Taiji&quot;, &quot;Second Exposure&quot; and &quot;Ring Envoy&quot;. In the same year, &quot;Golden A&quot; had a classic line: &quot;All things in heaven and earth, you are given to you, you are yours; you can&#39;t grab it if you don&#39;t give it.&quot; &quot;Tongquetai&quot; does not understand this truth, and the wind has committed crimes, which has made Niu Jin, Letting the box office exceed 100 million, still can not escape the fiasco of the end. It is said that the Changying Group has made money in the real estate developer business in recent years. The author believes that it is okay to establish a &quot;Tongquetai&quot; movie theme park, and develop and develop tourism, and may even earn money. &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; claims to invest 200 million yuan, which is purely a boast of not paying taxes, but there is no 200 million yuan, and what is declared, 60 million is also there. But the mistake is that the investor chose the old theme of &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; and took so many times. Everyone knows the story. Who knows? After Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung&#39;s two major shadows, South Korean handsome movie star Zhang Dongjian, has not been brilliant in the past, and they are often frustrated at the box office, &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; can not run. In fact, when Chen Guofu sipped for &quot;Tai Chi&quot;, he called &quot;Everyone will change the file period&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; should run! Who knows that the investor&#39;s face is thin, the bones are super hard, and they are not dead with their opponents. When &quot;Taiji&quot; &quot;Tongjitai&quot; &quot;Second Exposure&quot; on the &quot;China Good Voice&quot; final propaganda, &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; and the face of the official microblogging claimed that &quot;we do not want to delay the time of the people&quot;, the time of the people really No delay, because &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; was not seen in the National Day file, the box office was smashed by four opponents! Box office: The mainland&#39;s 79.7 million + overseas more than 20 million Huang Baiming&#39;s &quot;the strongest happy event&quot; rotten to the limit, but Donnie Yen, Gu Tianle, Cecilia Cheung, Carina Lau, Yang Ying, Deng Lixin and other stars gathered together, so I rushed through the 170 million box office. This led to the birth of &quot;Eight Stars and Happiness&quot;, but unfortunately called Yang Mi, this piece is still unmistakable, and with the declaration of up to 75 million. No one had thought that the ordinary people actually learned fine, that is, they did not buy it, and the &quot;Eight Star&quot; box office suffered a fiasco. Investor income: 120 million box office +20 million other profits Feng Xiaogang has been plagued by fans in the transformation of the New Year&#39;s comedy. However, the &quot;Assembly&quot; and &quot;Tangshan Earthquake&quot; all refer to the theme of the main theme, and they have the backing of the government, so the box office has broken the record. The former also Spike the &quot;name of the cast&quot;, winning quite disgraceful. However, as the saying goes: &quot;There is no need to return the company sooner or later.&quot; When Feng Xiaogang did not have a government package, the company invested in the &quot;1942&quot; with Huayi Brothers and other companies, and it was destined to go back to no return. Although &quot;1942&quot; won the Beijing Film Festival Award and the Rome Film Festival Award, its reputation is also good, Huayi Brothers even occupied the IMAX Hall, and smashed the &quot;Juvenile School&quot; directed by Ang Lee, but the film wanted Into all legal and illegal means, so that their first day of the film up to 40%, is still the audience is not willing to buy. Eventually, the &quot;1942&quot; box office collapsed and caused the stock of Huayi Brothers to plummet. Feng Xiaogang repeatedly relied on the government to earn money from the people. This time it was counted back to the original form. From &quot;Looking for Guns&quot; to &quot;Kekexili&quot; to &quot;Nanjing! Nanjing! ã€‹, Director Lu Chuan has been pursuing quality and lost the box office. But &quot;Nanjing! Nanjing! &quot;The best film in Spain was won, so that SMI has a reason to invest in &quot;The Feast of the King.&quot; Unexpectedly, Lu Chuan was conspicuous. &quot;The feast of the king&quot; said that it is a good version of the cottage version of Akira Kurosawa. If it is not good, it is the &quot;three-in-one&quot; of the stinking shame of &quot;The Panting&quot;. Black, smashing the broken picture, not talking about the people&#39;s words, the messy plot, no fighting, no brain, no scenes, let the &quot;king of the king&quot; to &quot;King&#39;s leftovers.&quot; Lu Chuan shouted &quot;The King&#39;s Feast&quot; at the box office over 300 million å¨¶ å²š çš„ çš„ çš„ çš„ çš„ çš„ , , , , , , , , , , ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ ã€‚ In order to avoid &quot;Painting 2&quot;, &quot;Wang&#39;s Feast&quot; was moved to the end of the year, and it was also on the same day as &quot;1942&quot;. The speculation of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, it met the &quot;Jianpi 2&quot; more powerful &quot;Junior&quot; &quot;&quot; Thai?&quot;, died. Investment: about 80 million + 22 million rpm pseudo 3D It is said that &quot;Blood Drops&quot; was originally scheduled to be a summer file, but &quot;Painting 2&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; are too hot, so that SMI is scared. I chose to heat up in December, and I will fight for the &quot;Twelve Zodiac&quot;, and I want to copy the miracle of &quot;Longmen Flying A&quot; PK &quot;Thirteen Dragonfly&quot;. During the period, &quot;Painted Skin 2&quot; and &quot;Tai Chi&quot; series pseudo-3D, and let &quot;Blood Drops&quot; quickly follow the wind. But Yan Jingtian, Huang Xiaoming, Yu Wenle, and Li Yuchun couldnâ€™t help.Blood Drops, 20% of the first day of the filming rate, you speculate to take a bad film, will inevitably be retribution. Because of the attendance rate and word of mouth is too stinky, &quot;Blood Drops&quot; hangs. When this film was selected by Chen Kexin as the director of Liu Weiqiang, it revealed a bad film. Everyone knows that Chen Kexin is using his team and director, and he wants to circle money. As a result, &quot;Twelve Zodiac&quot; and &quot;Thai?&quot; met by &quot;Blood Drops&quot;, which is more than &quot;Picture 2&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. This kind of box office only got more than 71 million. In addition, Chen Kexin and Liu Weiqiang saw the situation is not good, immediately specializing in overseas markets, and finally &quot;Blood Drops&quot; in the North American box office up to 5,000 US dollars, high is really high! It is said that the &quot;Taichi&quot; series was originally looking for Li Lianjie to play, the latter read the script and directly scared away. The gold medal producer Chen Guofu, with Cheng Xiaoze and Zhang Jialu two screenwriters, did not seriously change the script, but found the big bad film &quot;Jingwu Family&quot; mixed director Feng Delun. A group of movies that didn&#39;t want to go out of the ordinary road began to madly wild, and soon added less than 100 million investment scales to a 220 million two-part series. The longer the shot, the longer it doesn&#39;t matter. Because the pothole film &quot;Painted Skin 2&quot; used a pseudo 3D accident to circle the big money, let the group of people who want to empty the white wolf all day. Therefore, &quot;Taiji&quot; not only did not split into the upper and lower episodes of the two episodes, but also caused fake 3D fraud. When Chen Guofu Niu X banged and shouted &quot;Your shift period&quot;, who knows &quot;Tongquetai&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Relationship&quot; and &quot;Second Exposure&quot; did not shift the period, but also provoked the Chinese and American co-production &quot;Ring Envoy&quot;. In the end, &quot;Taiji&quot; relied on the advantage of IMAX+3D to win the 150 million box office championship in the National Day, but the heavy price was the loss. &quot;Taiji 1&quot; word of mouth is stinking enough, &quot;Tai Chi 2&quot; is naturally stinky to the slag, the two films do not look at 260 million box office, the visual loss is more than 110 million. Director Chen Guofu, who had directed &quot;Shuangyu&quot; and &quot;Wind&quot;, was completely out of the Huayi Brothers because of the fiasco of the &quot;Taiji&quot; series &quot;1942&quot;. In addition to relying on the &quot;Di Renjie&quot; series to turn over, the buddy is also preparing to take Wu Ershan&#39;s &quot;Ghost Blowing Light&quot;. Send him a sentence &quot;Reassuring on the road!&quot; Director Er Dongsheng is easy to rely on the crude &quot;King of the King of Guns&quot;, earned a ticket MONEY in the Mainland! His &quot;There is a way to you&quot;, immediately defeated the box office. At this time, Er Dongsheng thought of the comedy &quot;The Big Magician&quot;. Does the Lunar New Year not like this mouth? Liang Chaowei, Zhou Xun, Liu Qingyun, Wu Gang, and other guest appearances of Xu Ke, Wu Yanzu, Wang Ziwen, etc., the lineup is luxurious enough? Bona President Yu Dong is promoting &quot;LongmenAt the time of Flying A, he also slammed &quot;The Magician&quot; and blew &quot;Zhou Xun if this is more than 500 million box office, he changed his name to Zhou Shiyi&quot;, but he did not expect that &quot;The Big Magician&quot; pressed hard. &quot;Pleasant Goat 5&quot;, &quot;Anti-War&quot;, &quot;Eight Stars and Happiness&quot; won the box office champion in the same period, and was actually broken by the Hollywood blockbuster &quot;Mission Impossible 4&quot;. When everyone applauded for the climbing feat of Ah Tang in Burj Khalifa, no one ever asked the tricks and anti-Japanese in &quot;The Magician&quot;, so this piece was lost! Director Er Dongsheng can only count on &quot;I am a passerby&quot; and &quot;The Sword of the Three Young Masters&quot; turned over. Du Yuezhen&#39;s subject matter is actually the most unpopular? What is the most classic &quot;Shanghai Emperor&quot;? The box office is not as expected, lost! &quot;McDonald&#39;s brother + Xiao Ruoyuan + Pan Wenjie&quot; gold combination, from then on. It led to Xiao Ruoyuan to return to the film circle until 18 years later, &quot;3D Meat Fut&quot;. This kind of hot potato, who dares to shoot again? Wang Jing dared, it is said that he wanted to shoot from 2007, no one has invested. Itâ€™s easy to make a fortune in Fortuna Inn and win the investment of Bonaâ€™s CEO Yu Dong. Wang Jing Lai came to Zhou Runfa and Huang Xiaoming. &quot;Two generations of Xu Wenqiang&quot; played &quot;Great Shanghai&quot; and changed the story of Du Yuezhen into an anti-Japanese hero and love route, and simply killed the Lunar New Year. However, in order to avoid &quot;1942&quot;, &quot;Greater Shanghai&quot; chose to return from December 8 to December 21, and made a fatal mistake. &quot;1942&quot; was defeated at the box office, &quot;Thai?&quot; was released in advance, &quot;Twelve Zodiac&quot; was like a broken bamboo, &quot;Blood Drops&quot; swears to resist, so that &quot;Great Shanghai&quot; completely has no living space. The first day of the film is only 14%, not even as good as &quot;Blood Drops&quot; 20%! From the &quot;Confucius&quot; &quot;Tongquetai&quot;, Chow Yun-fat couldn&#39;t hold the box office. Huang Xiaoming&#39;s leg injury delayed the propaganda, and eventually &quot;Great Shanghai&quot; lost. This is the best movie that Wang Jing has directed in the new century, but in exchange for such an ending, God&#39;s will!",movie
599,"Last night, I ran the mad wind and heavy rain of the rotten country and went to see the movie. I was handsomely looked at by Loki, and I was satisfied with the return home. About the cause of the story, sum up with the god of the friend, that is, the bad guy: The artifact was robbed, then I want revenge! A long, long time ago, Thor&#39;s grandfather defeated a group called the Dark Elves, and made a small mistake in destroying a flowing material artifact that sounded like a &quot;doctor&quot;. Grandfather and Dark Elves greatly thought that the artifact was destroyed, but Actually not. Grandfather came home with gloriousness, and the dark elf fell asleep with the sorrow of the egg. The story returned to Earth, and Jane continued her research in the two years after Thor left. With a new date, Max (the fog) also had his own intern, and everyone lived in peace. Until that day Max discovered a supernatural phenomenon in a waste factory. When Jane and his team began to explore in the factory, Jane, as the girlfriend of the pig&#39;s foot, also opened the aura of pig&#39;s feet, immediately found the entrance to the world, and inhaled the flowing artifact. (The dark elves who have searched for artifacts in the universe for countless years but have no fruit have cried a lot.) The story is here. My friends and I feel that the woman is going to go back to see her boyfriend. The result is that the screenwriter has not let us down. Thor did not miss the opportunity, and found Jane&#39;s anomaly, revealing the sad expression of the egg, and took her back to Askar (see) Governance (father) treatment (mother). When Jane and Thor performed an Asca sightseeing, the Dark Elves were greatly awakened and felt the location of the artifact, so they pretended to be arrested and mixed into the Aska cell. The lens turned to Loki in the dungeon. My friends and I donâ€™t have to ask, where is this? number! child! This is obviously a superior suite! Loki is still elegant! The dark elf spies blasted in the dungeon and released all kinds of fierce prisoners. Then, here a highlight, the dark elf spy released all kinds of prisoners, then looked at his small body in front of Loki cell, and finally turned and walked away &gt; &lt;laughing cry. Then in order to protect the Jane pig teammates, the queen was greatly killed by the dark elves. (Loki knows that her motherâ€™s performance is quite touching. The friend said that Lokiâ€™s favorite is now mom, and she is disappointed with the two fathers and sons. Then Lokiâ€™s big wave postpartum weakness in the trailer is this time. &gt;,,, &lt;) In short, Thor is in a last resortUnder the circumstances decided to find a brother to help, the younger brother also tweaked a bit and then happily agreed. (Friends heard it, saying that the secret channel in the first part of Loki with the Frost Giant invasion allowed them to leave Askar without being noticed, so Thor decided to ask him for help.) Then the next paragraph was all highlighted without urine. point. The Loki that was released became a voice, and all kinds of brothers around him, so cute! Become a Captain America! Being handcuffed! Was pushed by my brother to fly the ship! Tucao scorpion is so cute! Thor and Loki played a bitter test and succeeded in letting the Frost Giants take in the dark matter from Jane. (At the beginning of this paragraph, as an audience with unknown truth, watching Loki raging brother, but also licking his brother&#39;s hand, his heart is broken in the heart, swaying Loki, wake up a minute before the screaming Have you forgotten it!) But this time Loki didn&#39;t let us down. He helped his brother to fight monsters and stood up to protect the scorpion from the sandstorm (and then took a look at his brother with a small eye&gt;\\\&lt;). In this section, Loki students were almost inhaled into the black hole again. I think this is to echo with Raytheon. However, this time my brother didn&#39;t have Let you go, just as Loki was about to break in, his brother flew heroes to save the United States. (Then we then said that the girlfriends are all clouds, just the director to make the show look straight and join the NPC). In order to save the brother, Loki and the monsters are gone, Loki is lying on the dying In the arms of my brother, the skin is getting paler and paler, and the tearful eyes look at my brother, and I keep talking about I&#39;m sorry. I think Thor has forgiven Loki at this time, and now in his eyes, in his arms is only the younger brother he has always loved. Thor told Loki that his father would do everything for you. Loki smiled, it was very distressing, saying: I am not doing it for him. Thor is stunned. (If you can play the curtain at the moment, my friends and I will definitely add the two screens to you back! Old! Home! Knot! Married!) Loki died in his brother&#39;s arms. Sandstorms cover up people&#39;s sorrow. Thor returned to the earth with his girlfriend and the sadness of the egg and made a big battle with the dark elves. During this period, my friends and I were immersed in the sadness of Lokiâ€™s death. I didnâ€™t even concentrate on watching the drama. I just thought that Jane and my teammates opened the door to the world, Thor and Dark.The spirit is almost broken by their play. In addition to Max and her interns, and Thor&#39;s subway ride in London, there are not many highlights. The final result is of course that the Dark Elves have been greatly cleaned up by Thor. The story reversal, it turns out that Loki is just a fake death (how can Loki die so easily!), and turned into a guard back to Aska. I have different understandings with my friends about the next story. The guard (Loki) returned to Aska and told Odin that he did not find anyone and only found a body. Odin greatly shocked, thought about it: Loki? At this time, the eyes of the guard (Loki) glimpsed. My understanding is that Loki said that he found the body. He only said half of it to test Odin. Odin knew that one of his sons was dead. He struggled in his heart and asked if Loki indicated that his inner luck was that Thor was still alive. Odin&#39;s reaction made Loki completely disappointed with his father. Therefore, the story of the final Thor returned to Askar to see Odin is Loki pretend, I think Loki may be completely undermine or to kill (not ~ ~) father. Thor&#39;s classmates want beauty, don&#39;t want to go to the mountains, and decide not to do king and go to the earth to find a girlfriend. Loki smiled and listened to Thor&#39;s confession and blessed him. Thor said: thank you father, then left. At this time, Loki, who turned back to the real body, sat on the throne and looked at the back of Thor&#39;s departure. His eyes were deep and he said: No, thank you. However, I saw a comment saying that in the end, Loki looked down at his brother and said that his brother should not go. He did not remember this kind of plot. In short, after this part of Loki&#39;s personality is getting fuller and fuller, from the first one lacking the father&#39;s love, M has grown into a planner and more complex conspirators (?), the film finally &quot;Thor will come back &quot;Great, I look forward to the story of the two of them in love in the next section!&quot; One is satisfying! For different understandings, please leave a message to me, ah, ah, a face of blood, a cavity to vomit, meet me ah ah ah ah",movie
600,"It is said that Keanu and Chen Hu are acquainted with &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Chen Hu is a member of Yuan Jiaban. During the filming period, he served as a martial arts coach of Keanu. The two hit it off and became friends for many years. Later, Keanu experienced the most painful period of life, his girlfriend died, and the children in the abdomen died. This seems to reflect his best friend?? Ruifan? Phoenix, 93 years of drug abuse over the past, quite a bit of the tragic feeling of a lonely star. The grief-stricken Keanu has been devastated since then, and his career has plummeted. For many years, Keanuâ€™s unshaven, middle-aged photo of the blushing media, is his true portrayal. Fortunately, Chen Hu, accompanied him when he was the most lonely, gave him warmth and gave him strength, which was the success of Keanu&#39;s weight loss today. Therefore, Keanu personally directed the film &quot;Tai Chi Xia&quot; and let Chen Hu starred in order to repay this precious marriage. &quot;Tai Chi Xia&quot; is full of Americans&#39; romantic imagination of Chinese martial arts. The understanding of Taiji has risen to the height of the philosophy of the universe. Compared with the affordable pursuit of the old lady in China, the high-end has more than one order of magnitude. The storyline is not a type that the Chinese like, but it is also unfortunate. What must be emphasized is still the martial arts part. Yuan Baye finally returned to the hard-wired horse&#39;s style of the military, and even integrated the actual combat action of mixed fighting. At this point Tony Jia is no longer sparse. It is said that Chen Hu is the second Chinese to win the National Karate Championship after Bruce Lee. Many of them gossip, and it is said that the myth of Bruce Lee is a fake cloud, not to mention it. Looking at Chen Huâ€™s performance in the film alone has already broken the stalemate of Donnie Yenâ€™s outrage. Other martial arts actors are also very exciting. Among them, there is a drama of Hong Boxing and Iron Cloth. The performance is quite pure, comparable to the level of the Shaw era. Many people think that Chen Hu is not good-looking. I think that the long-haired face in the middle of the long hair is quite a master. He is the baby that Keanu gave to the Chinese military. If you take good care of it, you must have a few extras. I can&#39;t just know that I don&#39;t pick up the green, I really want to suppress it. What is it? The star is shaped.

Seeing the title of the film, I know that it will be a pure and infinitely infirmary, but I accidentally saw the sorrow suffered by the single-parent family who lost the father&#39;s love. Grandma who was deceived by money, with a hard-working daughter-in-law, grateful to Dadeâ€™s grandson. It is such a grandson of three generations, who bear the weight of life silently. Looking at the three of them with a weak force in their different degrees of tolerance for the difficult life, it seems to remind us of those who are quiet and hard-working relatives at home, especially the oldest people. The film was directed by Taiwanâ€™s new director, Yan Youning. The fat girl Lin Meixiu played her mother and changed her image of Aiâ€™s gentle care in the â€œStars of the Dayâ€. It was a bit harsh and sturdy, but still tolerable. Grandma is represented by Taiwanâ€™s famous Henan opera actor Zhang Xiaoyun at the age of 85. The grandson is in the &quot;rolling!&quot; In the letter of Ashin, he played with Pei Yukunâ€™s acting singer Ke Yulun. The film not only made a name for itself in the box office of Taiwan, but also won the 50th Taiwan Film Golden Horse Award and won the best supporting actress and best original script. Also nominated for the best original script, &quot;Parents are not at home&quot;, &quot;Days are destined&quot;, &quot;Poison War&quot;, &quot;Chinese partners&quot;, I wonder if there will be a bloody road in the strong hands such as Lin, but also unknown ! The film also revives the dead father, from time to time in the heart of his son, inspiring to encourage the life of a family to continue. The bridge that washes the back of the grandmother is unparalleled and warm to the extreme. Riding a grandmother with a motorbike and discussing the dialogue with the aliens is even more enviable. After the death of my grandmother, there is no deliberate expression of grief, just more affirmation and mission for my grandmother, making people feel so natural and warm and beautiful. In any case, Taiwanese family movies have always insisted on the purest feelings of human beings. This is a matter of great comfort for the Chinese people.",movie
602,"The old Maozi war film, I feel the same as the old Maozi&#39;s vodka, not fancy but never hides the enthusiasm, burning heart and burning stomach. Unlike the mass-produced Uncle Samâ€™s recruiting promo, Hollywoodâ€™s old man never shows off high-tech. He likes guns and bloody knives. He doesnâ€™t engage in mainstream values. He only tells you two things: I kill him. Because if I don&#39;t kill him, he wants to kill me, and I kill him because he killed our people. This kind of logic is simple and straightforward to understand. It is a model of violent aesthetics. It is different from the various unidentified consciousness of the neon country. It is different from the universal values â€‹â€‹of the US emperor with a sense of honor. The old Maozi directly catches people&#39;s survival. Instinct, there is basically no barrier to acceptance, once the role is brought in, it can be assimilated. This is also the reason why I can&#39;t wait for them to see the old Maozi film. This film is the same reason, it is very happy to look at it. In particular, the production of blood under the film has made so many luxurious props: the fourth tank with three long bodies running on the ground, a rare third assault gun, a half crawler motorcycle, 45mm anti-tank gun , 37mm anti-aircraft guns, 82mm mortars, and extremely rare 280mm and 320mm rockets; there are Junker 88, Junker 87 in the sky, the emblem of the old Maozi in the firearms and the German symbols mg34 and mp38 have performance . In particular, three No. 4 tanks, in order to prepare for the &quot;Save the Great Ryan&quot;, the props teacher used the T-34/85 to change the Tiger style, earning enough praise. However, this group of props really has no professionalism at all. It is purely expected to eat freshly all over the sky. This time, the tank is welded with a circle of decks to pretend to be the fourth, and the operation is broken. But for the military fans, you can see the hard goods of the World War II era slamming on the sand table, coupled with Imax&#39;s incomparable inflammatory sound effects, heart rate and adrenaline have already exploded, these details, who care? For many military fans, even if there is no story and no plot, even if they are directed at these props, plus the classic sand table of the Pavlov Building and the Children&#39;s Palace Statue Fountain, they will be willing to buy a pocket. Not to mention the close-range melee and explosion effects of the flesh and blood in the film. As a pure war film, this film not only passes, but also gets a pretty beautiful score. After all, the film&#39;s scenes and special effects are separated by at least a few streets under the banner of Stalingrad, and the producers of &quot;Below the City&quot; are the only ones to prepare for the film.The quantity of props is Jude Law. Scenes and good-looking props are just the necessary conditions for the passing of war films. If you want to be advanced, you still have a good story. It is a pity that at this point, &quot;S&quot; is not only not a surprise, but a lot of points. First of all, the entire film lacks a necessary introduction to the background of the story. Except for the niche fans, it is unclear to see the ordinary audience outside Russia. For example, my family leader, after reading the meditation for a long time, asked: They are waiting for the building to not go back, and this film has a relationship with Stalin for the name of Stalingrad? ...no words are condensed and there are wood! Generally speaking, the story is laid out and the foreshadowing is seriously cut corners. For example, why the squad has to cross the river, and why the film has not been obeyed after crossing the river. Don&#39;t answer me with the importance of the Volga River and the landing site. These information videos, which should be introduced as necessary backgrounds, are not mentioned, but the default audience already knows. What is even more tragic is that skipping the foreplay is the climax of the climax, usually very short. Sure enough, the narrative rhythm of the whole film continued to drag after the female pig&#39;s foot officially appeared. The introduction of the five male masters was blunt and lame, and the director made a presentation with the ppt and the red dot pen for the audience: Look, this is our starring! More even, the female pigâ€™s feet are in this man. The film of the main melody is completely a decoration, more like a habitual complex of humanistic care under the main theme of Hollywood. Even without her, the film is like: landing failure - defending the building - and the story structure of the enemy. Seeing this, I can&#39;t help but sigh for the production. The paying of the writer is a white flower. All in all, the good scenes match the bad stories, but the background of the United States and Russia co-productions, this kind of twisting on the narrative technique is not so unforgivable. Good story good scenes, still not enough to support a meaningful war film. The style is a little higher, you should have a good idea, or the main theme of the film is to be brilliant. It is a pity that if the hardships in the narrative are still not enough to show that the United States and Russia are parting ways in their values, the chaos of the film is actually showing the dreams of the two people in the same bed or not. Old Mao said that fascism is shameful to launch aggression! The US emperor said that war is cruel and there are no good people, you are also bad people! Lao Maozi said, well, we agree that the war is cruel, and the US emperor said that there should be humanity care when it is cruel! Lao Maozi said that we can carry out humanistic care for the female pig&#39;s feet. The US emperor said that German soldiers have a sense of honor and need humanistic care. Drinking water can&#39;t kill! Old Mao said, ..., the US emperor said, GermanyThe national officer is a victim of war. He and his mistress are true love and cannot kill! Old Mao said, ..., the US emperor said that there are teenagers in the German army, they are also victims, and can not kill! Lao Maozi said that the cheeses don&#39;t play with them, fire at me, don&#39;t let me live, don&#39;t want to live! So the whole film started in a mess and ended abruptly. Although there is a reflection on war and death, it is like a itch in the boots, and it is reflected in the reflection for reflection. Convincingly rethinking the war, generally speaking two ways. From the personal story experience, we can tell the twist of war on human nature, such as &quot;Our Fathers&quot;. This kind of discussion answers why war is bad. Another higher or more pleasing angle is to discuss the meaning of living under the premise of exposing the cruelty of war and death. It is good to answer why peace and no war, such as &quot;Save the Great Ryan.&quot; This type of discussion tends to feed your three views and eat a bitter sweet chocolate, so that you can understand why chocolate should not be bitter, and the effect is better than simply telling you not to be bitter. From this perspective, &quot;Zheng&quot; is a war film with a high degree of height. Although the technology of the film industry has been continuously improved for more than a decade, the status of the Spiel format has not been shaken, even if it is also Spiel. Gee&#39;s &quot;Horse&quot; also failed to complete the transcendence of self, although the latter&#39;s storytelling skills and sentiments have surpassed domestic counterparts for decades. Each country or nation has its own unique temperament and characteristics, which are often rooted in history. Beyond the scope of culture, the commonality of value orientation is tantamount to fishing for the moon. In fact, this is not a film for everyone. The film rigidly requires the audience to first understand the significance of Stalingrad to the Soviet Union and the significance of the Battle of Stalingrad to the entire Eastern Front and the old Mao nationality. Under the premise background, let&#39;s discuss the ups and downs of the fate of the little man and life and death. This background setting defines the audience for this film. In fact, the main purpose of this film is to enhance the national spirit of the Russian audience&#39;s resonance and cohesion, this cohesive force is crucial for the rising countries. As for each nation, they have their own Stalingrad, just as each nation has its own Nanjing. The key to the problem is not only answering what has happened, but how we look at it. This view should not be influenced by ideology, only related to nationality. What kind of attitude we reflect on the past is likely to determine what kind of we will have.Come.",movie
603,"This animation is too fast, just think about it, because I didn&#39;t like this style at first, I didn&#39;t plan to watch it, but the word of mouth was really good. I also came to join in the fun. I found out that this is a win-win concept. Animation. A lot of animations are very fresh, telling a story that is not painful, but this animation is not like this, the rhythm is really dragging, but the concept expressed by animation is indeed beyond the cruelty of general animation. One of my colleagues said that this film is Japan&#39;s war mobilization film. The tenacious human beings are Japanese, and the giants are Chinese. They enhance the glory of enlisting through the praise of the soldiers&#39; fighting spirit. The names of the people are all Europeanized, and the characters are also generally white (the Japanese have been hiding their hatred and fear in the United States), and the national self-esteem and inferiority are undoubtedly revealed. I think this interpretation is OK. Recently, everyone can feel that the situation is not very peaceful, but I also think that a particularly large-scale war should not be, but local conflicts may still be true. However, even if this film has such deep meaning, the effect will be two-way. The young people in Japan will be inspired to see that the young people in China can also see that the information conveyed by this film is very simple, if you donâ€™t rise. Resistance is only the end of being eaten. Japan is always a strong and terrible neighbor in my mind. They have a tenacious spirit, strict discipline, advanced science and unsatisfied ambition. They have many excellent spirits and are more energetic than our ancient people. They are more angry, but their ambitions are indeed very threatening. It is not necessarily that you are dead and alive, but if you want to be safe, you must be strong enough to be possible. The film is also very profound in portraying human nature. Even if you sacrifice for the country, you will not be able to appreciate your compatriots. People are more concerned with their own interests. Therefore, I am not trying to shake things here. What blind patriotic feelings, I believe that people do not have the necessary patriotic obligations, if this country is to protect the interests of the majority, if you feel protected, you should indeed protect the country, when the country does not care about the majority When you are alive or dead, you can vote by action. There is no need for loyalty. I am not a war lover. I love peace more than war. We don&#39;t need such conspiracy theories. Maybe this film just wants to talk about the struggle between all mankind and the poor living conditions. As a post-80, I alsoI often live very depressed. We are a generation that loses vitality in the media. In fact, we don&#39;t want to be energetic. We do have a lot of unexpected burdens. But after thinking about it, it is true that the world is cruel, and there is not much warmth for other species. The world where pigs, cows, and chickens are born is not just for being eaten by people, so I want to open more when I think about it. I will encounter such hardships, but since I can have the will, I will not accept it. I really think that there are very few things that people can change. In the face of natural disasters, in front of wars, and in the face of the times, we all feel like the dwarves face giants. The strength of the two sides is too different, and they often have such helplessness. Most things in life can&#39;t be changed through hard work, but even if you don&#39;t know how to hope, you still want to fight. Because there is no change in the inaction, there is a possibility of turning around when there is resistance. This is life. dignity. I don&#39;t believe in freedom, equality, and democracy. In my opinion, absolute freedom is absolutely non-existent; society will never be equal, because people have the difference in talent from birth, plus the difference in the effort of the day after tomorrow. The treatment should be different. The society that enables different types of people to do their best is a society that I think is ideal. Some people who contribute to society have little contribution to society, so there is a difference between people. I can accept the difference in level; another is democracy. Most people&#39;s opinions are not necessarily correct opinions, and the group&#39;s ideas are actually very easy to be manipulated. The world is still under the control of a small number of people. of. My fight is not for the sake of happiness for human beings. I just want to talk as little as possible and do more practical things. I will become a person who respects myself. Life is endless and fighting is not stop.",movie
604,"Yan Geling was born in Shanghai in the late 1950s. His father was a writer and his mother was a dancer of the Cultural Art Troupe. Yan Geling grew up with his parents in the writer&#39;s compound and grew up in a strong artistic atmosphere. Yan Geling ridiculed her reason for becoming a writer in the short essay &quot;Writing Manuscripts&quot;: &quot;It is said that there are three factors that lead to the success of a novelist. Of course, talent is excluded. One is divorced by parents (or early mourning), and the other is in the family. Falling, the third is congenital and weak. After rough verification, it is found that Cao Xueqin and Lu Xun are in the same two cases, and the Bronte three sisters are all good at all, and the other ones are reasonable in all cases. Itâ€™s like taking advantage of it and earnestly pursuing it. Itâ€™s a strong word, and itâ€™s so good that itâ€™s round. Itâ€™s just disdain, suddenly realizing that it happens to have these three factors. Success has no shadow, three unfortunate but always saddle before me, I am not familiar with Re-cooked... Like other parents who are used to crying, I am used to crying parents. &quot;No matter whether this ridiculous discussion of the reason why writers become writers is reasonable, but Yan Gehao himself, family Her influence is crucial. From the frequent quarrels of parents, Yan Geling slowly walked into many emotional worlds that were more unfortunate, richer and more conflicting than their parents. The emotional world of the whole &quot;people&quot; will be the material and source of Yan Geling&#39;s creation as a future novelist. . The unfortunate childhood is the wealth of a writer&#39;s life. The uneasy soul experience of childhood will dominate the fate of a person&#39;s life and lay the foundation of a person&#39;s life. &quot;Uneasy&quot; needs a breakthrough, and it needs to be vented to release, so the text becomes the best way to pin. From a young age, Yan Ge, who is sensitive to physique, is suffering from anemia, and is suffering from oral ulcers. He is a child who â€œsatisfied and sleeplessâ€. Such children play a childhood game with a group of friends, playing in the scorpion, hide and seek, and always Can not take advantage of. But soon she discovered that she had an advantage that others did not have, that is, telling a story. The father&#39;s collection gave her a broad perspective. What is contrary to the times is that the father&#39;s collections rarely have popular books at the time, such as &quot;Red Flag&quot; and &quot;Song of Youth&quot;. Maybe this It is also an important factor in making Yan Geâ€™s estrangement from the times and reflection on the times. Most of his father&#39;s books are classic foreign classics. Yan Geling, who is in his teens, began to read one novel after another from the bookshelf, from Xiao Zhongma&#39;s &quot;La Traviata&quot; to Hugo&#39;s &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;. &quot;, Les Miserables&quot;, &quot;Smile Face&quot;. A few years later, Yan Geling recalled why she became a novelist. In addition to the genetic factors, the father&#39;s collection gave her the most important enlightenment. From reading alone to sharing with the small friends in the compound is an interesting experience of her childhood, and Yan Geling is also good at tampering with the plot she doesn&#39;t like, and doing a self-reprocessing process. In the retelling story, Yan Geling experienced the wisdom and interest of a language. This is the way that Yan Geyu first became attached to the text. He experienced the life in the text and reality too early, and Yan Geyi also entered the adult consciousness field prematurely. Precociousness may be the trait of Yan Geyi&#39;s generation. Yan Ge&#39;s childhood was exactly the 1960s in China. The memory left to us in the 1960s may be an avid sport, a slogan of blood-sucking or a memory of hunger. The childhood of the 1960s was a period of extreme poverty, hunger and extreme enthusiasm. It was also a period of great betrayal and chaos. Manâ€™s persecution, oppression and precautions against human beings have presented their ultimate state in this history. In the three years of natural disasters in the early 1960s, the people faced great hunger. The new China is facing a severe period of development. The Soviet Union, which has always made good contacts with China, has begun to withdraw a large number of experts. The Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army is forced to become self-reliant on an empty stomach. The number of abnormal deaths and reduced births from 1959 to 1961 reached about 40 million, and the main cause of non-normal death was hunger. The war on the Sino-Indian border (1962), the debate between the two parties in the Sino-Soviet (1963), and the disagreement between the top leaders of the party were open to the public. Until May 16, 1966, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued the &quot;May 16 Notice&quot; and The 11th Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in August passed the &quot;Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution&quot;, marking the full launch of the &quot;Cultural Revolution.&quot; The &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; has entered the childhood of this generation and has become a memory that cannot be lost in a lifetime. Yan Gelingâ€™s initial impression of the â€œCultural Revolutionâ€ was a series of memories about the image. Yan Geling talked about her memory in a speech: â€œI started at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. In 66 years, I was seven years old. I remembered What is it? The &#39;Cultural Revolution&#39; left me with the impression of suicide. Everyone is committing suicide. I remember that I came back from the outside, on a very high floor, below the building is a group of people around me. I ran over and looked. The ground was muddy, there was a circle of holly outside, and there were two pits on the ground. It was a muddy land with two pits. Just two people, one old manAn old lady jumped upstairs and took two pits in the ground and was taken away. At that time, my heart was very shocked. I felt that after the two old people committed suicide, they were carried away. I donâ€™t know how they are, for what. Then I waited for two days and started to wind up. I still walked downstairs and found that a lot of sugar paper was floating upstairs and it was transparent. At that time, buying sugar was not so free, but also because of the supply of vouchers, so there are transparent sugar paper, a dozen or more, twenty, then fly down. After another two days, it is still flying down. I will link these two things together. The two old people jumped off the building. Before jumping off the building, they must buy the candy from the whole family and buy all the sugar. What do they talk about in the process of eating sugar? Talking about their life, talking about their children, talking about being detained and being wronged. After the talk, they finished eating the sugar and then jumped upstairs. Then the sugar paper was blown down from the upstairs within half a month, so this is an image of my suicide. It is not very fierce. Itâ€™s a very dark and terrible image, but a beautiful one. Basically, it seems like this pair of old people has turned butterflies. I think this pair of old people must be in love. They ate so much polysaccharide before they died. There are so many words to talk about together. In the end, it must be one that is involved and the other decides to accompany him to death. . So in my memory, the Cultural Revolution is such a thing, suicide is such a thing. &quot;In that era, a child saw a lot of death, persecution and betrayal, a tragic thing, but in the memory it turned into a beautiful image. Whether the memory is consistent with history, whether the memory is equal to the history The scene is not the most important issue. Yan Geling pays attention to history with the eyes of a novelist, and history has become a personal possession in his narrative. With the evolution of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, the cruelty and darkness in human nature are fierce. In reality, it is more and more fully demonstrated that precociousness is an inevitable fact for that generation. In the memory, Yan Geling said: &quot;When we entered the Cultural Revolution, we were all children. All kinds of humanity in the Cultural Revolution, the darkness of society and the dark parts of human nature are exposed to us prematurely. We can see the rich variables in human nature, and the endless transformation. A little chance will lead to the exposure of unexpected qualities in human nature. It was a period of great betrayal, and he saw that he betrayed himself, betrayed his family, and betrayed the same kind. so wePremature exposure to such a life, our generation is mature very early. It is also prematurely taking on the burden of the family. When we are very young, we have to buy food. In society, we must learn how to fight for it. For a piece of meat or bone, every day, three or four o&#39;clock, meat bones. Pulling out, we have to line up to quarrel with others. Life like a puppy is a very peculiar state from material life to spiritual life. This state pushes us into a deformed maturity. Of course, there are some good results in such maturity, most of them are good, let you experience life in a short time, and appreciate the life of the hundred. During the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, Yan Geling&#39;s family was also ransacked by the Red Guards. Both his father and his mother were hit by different degrees. His father was suspended from paying his salary, and he was assigned to the May 7th School to participate in labor reform. The family fell into material and spiritual duality. Difficult to say that Yan Ge is more fortunate than her contemporaries, she did not go to the countryside like a city youth, but participated in the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army, but the life of the military is not smooth, even more difficult in life, just relative to the general decent educated youth In fact, the People&#39;s Liberation Army still had the superiority of political identity at that time. The 12-year-old Yan Geling was admitted to the Chengdu Military Region Cultural Art Troupe and became a literary and artistic soldier who danced red ballet. After that, Yan Geling followed the Chengdu Military Region &quot;Iron Girl Wrangler Class&quot; Experience life. Yan Geyu talked about this experience in an interview: &quot;I went to the army to see the mountains, rivers, and clouds of Tibet. It is simply unimaginable for mainlanders. It is unthinkable to live in the alleys of Shanghai. At that time, I was riding a single ride, and I was a boy of the horse. So I feel that my whole process of growth is very lucky, what kind of life has been experienced, like I was with the girls to marry, I was 16 years old. I slept with them on the grass and slept with the horses. They called &quot;night grazing&quot;, where the horses went and where you followed. It is a very interesting life to sleep on a sheepskin squat. You can use the noodles to pick them up, because you can lick them without a flat land. Of course, I didn&#39;t imagine that I could become a writer. I used to dance to experience life, go horse riding, what, and live with them. &quot;This is the fiery life that Yan Geyu experienced in that fiery era, full of idealistic youth. The idealism left a deep mark on the generation born in the 1950s.This brand is endowed by the times and a gift of suffering. There is a difference between each generation and each generation. For example, the word &quot;I&quot; was born in the 40s and 50s, representing the country and the collective. In the 1960s, the people represented &quot;we&quot;? The generation of the 1960s Group pronouns, but for the 70s and 80s, only the &quot;self&quot; is represented. Writers in the late 1950s, between the 50s and 60s, &quot;I&quot; in their words, both national and collective meaning, but also the meaning of a generation. Most of the writers of the 1950s had the urge to write for the times, but the writers of the 1970s and 1980s did not bother to do so. They were more likely to return to the personal field. The female writers born in the 1970s were cotton, cotton, and And Anne Baby, who is popular from the Internet to the paper, has no trace of idealism in their words. Their loss has no other shore. They donâ€™t seek the other side, nor ask the ultimate meaning of life. They donâ€™t snuggle up. Do anything with idealism. In the 1979 counterattack against the war, just 21-year-old Yan Geling signed up to participate in the frontline field hospital dressing. There, I saw the heroicness of the soldiers in the war and their feelings. This experience is a turning point in life for Yan Geling. She began to write a lot of things. First, she wrote several small poems in the &quot;Liberation Army&quot; and military newspapers. After that, she went to the creative group of the military region. In this way, Yan Geling began to transform from a dancer on the stage to a dancer in the text. The rich experience of life in the past 20 years has made Yan Geè‹“ have more life feelings than his peers. In addition to the family history, the reading experience of the youth, this time began to give back to her little by little. In 1978, he published a fairy tale poem &quot;The Dialogue between a Protractor and a Playing Card&quot;. After this, Yan Geling was transferred to the Shanghai Film Studio and the Bayi Film Studio because of the creation of the film script. In 1980, he published the film literary drama &quot;Heart String&quot;. The following year, he was filmed by Shanghai Film Studio. &quot;Heart String&quot; portrayed two vivid figures, Li Xiaofeng and A-Muni, in a vivid and fluid language. Accurate, intriguing, and received praise from all walks of life. Only Yan, who is only 20 years old, has begun to rise in the movie world. After &quot;Xin Xian&quot;, Yan Geling has successively created a large number of film and literary plays such as &quot;The Missing Moon&quot;, &quot;Seven Warriors and One Zero&quot;, &quot;Great Desert Like Snow&quot;, &quot;Father and Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Queen of Innocent&quot; These scripts for various reasonsMany failed to make a film. Yan Geling, who grew up in a peaceful environment, often turned his eyes into the war-filled war years. While describing the imposing war scenes, he was able to add his own unique feminine emotions, and the softness and softness made each piece always full. Romantic, warm atmosphere, formed its own unique artistic style. In 1988, the film literary play &quot;The Refuge&quot; created by Yan Geling was once again put on the screen. Yan Geyu once again put a unique artistic perspective into the war, showing the cruelty of war through several women&#39;s encounters, and nuancedly explained several people. The protagonist&#39;s strong emotional ups and downs, the plot is lively and touching, with a heart-rending artistic appeal, winning the praise inside and outside the film world. In addition to film and literature creation, Yan Geling also created a large number of novels. From 1981 to 1986, she successively published short stories &quot;Onion&quot;, &quot;Ladies&quot;, &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;Song God and her twelve months&quot;, &quot;Sesame and Sesame&quot;, the novella &quot;You Come with me, I will give you water.&quot; In January 1986, Yan Geling&#39;s first novel &quot;Green Blood&quot; was published in &quot;Kunlun&quot; magazine, and was published by the People&#39;s Liberation Army Literature and Art Publishing House in April of the same year. At the end of the year, he joined the Chinese Writers Association and became the youngest member at that time. In addition, in November 1987, &quot;A whisper of a female soldier&quot;, in June 1989, &quot;The Meadow of the Female&quot; was published by the Liberation Army Literature and Art Publishing House. Since 1983, Yan Geling has been transferred from the Chengdu Military Region Cultural and Art Troupe to the Creative Team of the Railways Political Department as a creator, and later transferred to the Creative Team of the Railway Engineering Command of the Ministry of Railways as a creator. In 1988, he was invited by the US News Agency to visit the United States. After one year, he entered the Department of Literature and Writing of the Columbia College of Art, and later obtained a master&#39;s degree in art. She began another transition in her life and began another trek in her creative career. In the past 30 years, Yan Geling completed a successful reincarnation in mainland China, with a special era of Chinese memory, flew to the United States, a strange land, and started her new round of literature in a foreign country. trip. &quot;When you get to a new country, the things you touch every day are fresh and exciting. Even if you think about it in the past, because of the distance between geography, time, and cultural language, many past events are also fresh and strange. The meaning of thinking. Fortunately, I have such an opportunity to stay away from my homeland, like a transplant of life? I will uproot myself and plant it on a new soil. Before rooting on the new soil, the whole root of this life must be bare.It feels like all the nerves are naked, so I am naturally amazingly sensitive. Both the pain and the comfort are exaggerated in this sensitivity, and they all form a strong image and story in exaggeration. Then came out one novel after another. This paragraph is also a true soul portrayal of Yan Geyuâ€™s first visit to a foreign country. â€œTransplantationâ€ is an uprooting experience for Yan Geling. The language is unfamiliar, and the cultural barrier has once caused Yan Geâ€™s feeling of alienation and alienation in a foreign land. Her early immigrant novels partly reflected the life of this period. The early works reflect the author&#39;s marginal identity as a &quot;young woman from the mainland&quot;, intertwined with cultural differences and pain and confusion in expressing understanding. This part of the work also reveals the rooted pain of the author when he first came to a new country to contact with fresh culture. The process of cultural identity has not yet been completed. The &quot;I&quot; in the work usually has a high degree of identity with the author himself. The protagonist is a mainland woman, a foreign student, a literary writer, and a non-fluent English. He also has a sensitive nerve and wanders in a foreign country. &quot;Maroon Hair&quot; is a difference from language to culture. Explain the misplacement of understanding. The protagonist of the story &quot;I&quot; is just &quot;to the United States one month zero &quot;Day, is learning English,&quot; &quot;University specializes in Chinese literature, has studied eight years of dance, four years of ballet, four years of Chinese classical dance&quot; from the mainland women, &quot;I&quot; with a lame English and unfamiliar maroon The handsome American man with hair made a misplaced conversation. I replied: My friend will pick me up, thank you, don&#39;t need you to pick me up. He said: You are very... very special, very good looking, I have never seen I have been an ideal oriental woman of the classical type. I am right, the sky is very hot. Los Angeles is hot. But my friends will come, you donâ€™t have to worry.â€ The misplaced dialogue caused an unexpected The humorous effect, the language only represents the surface of the membrane, and the deep-seated barrier caused by culture is simply impossible to reconcile. â€œIâ€ accepted a part-time job in maroon hair. This is a reward for the model work of amateurs in the painting club. Compared with the salary of most international students, it is very rich. However, the self-respect of &quot;I&quot; as a Chinese person has often been subjected to the provocation of this group of arrogant Americans, even a crippled girl, when &quot;I&quot; prayed to her that she had praised her paintings very well. The other party showed a confident smile and said, &quot;The Chinese are long.Itâ€™s all like this. &quot;The boss asked &quot;I&quot; to do nude models and give them double rewards. The wrong language helped the &quot;I&quot;. &quot;I&quot; pretending to be confused with the boss&#39;s words. &quot;I&quot; and maroon hair There is always a gap that cannot be crossed. When he approaches &quot;I&quot;, he reveals the contempt for the &quot;Chinese&quot; without any cover, and allows &quot;I&quot; to maintain the distance from the chestnut hair. &quot;I&quot; changed again. A job, bathing a wealthy old lady. One day, &quot;I&quot; picked up the sapphire ring lost by Mrs. Campbell and gave it to her happily. She said, &quot;I will take it to the jewelry store for identification tomorrow. &quot;The collision between the two cultures and civilizations makes &quot;I&quot; once again in a state of aphasia. The author sent such feelings through &quot;I&quot;: &quot;In an instant, I returned to the initial chaotic state of this language. I don&#39;t understand it, and I feel lucky not to understand it. It is a language that always makes me feel distant and strange. &quot;At this time, &quot;I&quot; found the chestnut hair in the corner of the newspaper, he was looking for &quot;I&quot;! &quot;I&quot; felt his cry surrounded &quot;I&quot;. &quot;Respond? I am suffering. I am homeless. Responding to him will be a destination. No, maybe. One day, I will respond, that will make me really understand the day of shouting language. &quot;This is also the voice of Chinese people like &quot;I&quot; who live in a foreign country and desire to integrate into American society. In Western civilized society, the Chinese appear as &quot;others&quot;, whether in maroon hair or In the eyes of the amateur painters of the painting clubs, or the employer Mrs. Jubel, the Chinese are a person from a relatively poor country. They are lazy, dirty, and lacking in cultivation. In a heterogeneous culture. In the middle, &quot;I&quot; is more sensitive to the national self-esteem of the Chinese people. The stronger the frustration, the deeper the sense of dispersal. The early immigration works of Yan Geling have a very large autobiographical writing mode, and the uprooted experience makes the writers In the strange land, I feel a sense of freshness and loneliness. The author seems to use words again to eliminate the material and spiritual pressures of survival, until the writer gradually uses words to build his ideal country in Western society. At this time, Yan Geling really began to &quot;respond&quot; to the cry from the civilized society, understand them, and make their own voice, get a kind Peer-to-peer rights. Similar stories include &quot;Fangyue Cake&quot;, &quot;Robbery Charlie and Me&quot;, &quot;Story in School&quot;. The narrators of these novels are &quot;I&quot;, &quot;I&quot;In the foreign land. Yan Gewei&#39;s overseas creation took place in 1993. She created a movie script in China and was unknown to her. When she went overseas, she once again &quot;electric shock&quot;, but she made her a great success. Most of the scriptwriting is related to her own experience. The eight-year-old military life provides her with rich themes. Most of her screenplays show the theme of war. After immigration, Yan Geling writes with local experience and exotic experience. The memory of the mainland and the mainland. In 1993, the movie copyright of three novels was sold. Li An bought the &quot;Little Girl Fishing&quot; and Li Hanxiang bought the copyright of &quot;Female Host&quot;. Chen Chong bought the &quot;Day Bath&quot;. Copyright: &quot;Little Girl Fishing&quot; won six awards such as the &quot;Best Asia Pacific International Film Festival&quot; best film; &quot;Tian Bath&quot; won the 1998 Taiwan Film Golden Horse Award seven awards. The film not only brought Yan Gezhen economic income, More importantly, it has brought an international reputation. At this time, Yan Geling really came to the readers and the public. The economic pressure eased slightly. The tension in God began to slowly relax, and the author&#39;s style began to become brisk. The author began to create a large number of immigrant novels and novels about the memory of the mainland. Yan Geling&#39;s self-confidence through words has gradually become stronger, her strategy for strong civilization. It is to find a sense of spirituality and beauty in her own culture, so she has created a series of female characters as an ideal country for her literature. This is the one that Yange, born in the 1950s, must find meaning in literature. A self-supporting approach that combines the qualities of romanticism and realism. This was first seen in her early immigrant work, &quot;Little Girl Fishing,&quot; and later works, such as &quot;The People&quot; until the latest two published in 2006. The long &quot;The Ninth Widow&quot; and &quot;A Woman&#39;s Epic.&quot; Yan Geling has come out of the confusion of cultural identity. For her, she is talking about equality in the broader sense of culture and civilization.",movie
605,"In the early days of immigration, Yan Geyu created a large number of short story novels in addition to his busy homework. This part of the work has certain rough marks. Yan Gelingâ€™s early short stories usually set the beginning of a storytelling. The â€œstoryâ€ created the popularity and readability of some short stories in Yan Geling. She is good at advancing the story in a funny language. Assuming the existence of a storyteller, the beginning of many short stories of Yan Geling set up a reader&#39;s presence. Sometimes she consciously creates a structure that I am saying. Then, the story is sung. The second is generally taken in these short stories, the protagonist jumps to the reader in the first place; the third set suspense at the beginning, or set a suspense in the story, the important protagonist does not appear to cause the reader to read interest. First, assuming the presence of the reader is a common method used by Yan Geling&#39;s story narrative. &quot;The mainland sister is of course not called the mainland girl. Her name is too good. Don&#39;t let me write it. The mainland girl grows very well, so she is afraid to write and write it. What she can say is that she is quiet and quiet. More, moving is like static.&quot; (&quot;Continental Girl&quot;) at the beginning, the author stressed that he is writing a story of a mainland girl. &quot;At that time, I just arrived in the United States, and I was tired and tired all day. The elevators in the school were crowded like me. I was too afraid of people. The hot sweat of me was steaming me, even I sniffed out. The Chinese restaurant tastes.&quot; (&quot;The Story in the School&quot;) uses the past time to create a narrative structure of memories, which is the narrative technique of traditional storytelling. &quot;It has been ten years since it happened. Many people say that I grew up almost overnight, after that.&quot; (&quot;I am not an elf&quot;) This is also a narrative structure of memories. &quot;The story always begins like this: a wealthy, princely father; a sage, a kind mother who is a great man, and then there must be a beautiful, delicate, little girl who is adored with pearls.&quot; &quot;) directly point out that this is a story, the hypothetical audience will step into the story world step by step under the narrative framework set by the author. But this traditional setting is usually unstable, and the author will break the reader&#39;s reading expectations in the process of describing the story. Second, the beginning of the novel to push the protagonist to the short part of the reader, generally shorter, similar to the character sketch. This kind of writing is often limited by short stories. The author should enter the narrative at the story level as soon as possible, so the protagonist must jump into sight at the beginning. Such as: &quot;We never call Xiaoxiao &#39;small å©µ&#39;, the first oneAdd a &#39;skull&#39;. (&quot;Shantou Xiaoyan&quot;) &quot;Aunt Xiao Shan has been alone.&quot; One person buys a few meats, dozens of dishes, and a ginger size like a toe. &quot;(&quot;å°çŠé˜¿å§¨&quot;) &quot;Yuchuan is a foreigner, so I only live here to Caijia.&quot; &quot;(&quot;Nothing Men and Women&quot;) &quot;Black Baoge will be bald when he gets up. It is really something I can&#39;t expect.&quot; (&quot;Black Baoge&quot;) Third, the beginning of the novel and the formation of a kind of echo, open the door to the theme of expression, this title often contains a symbolic meaning. &quot;moon cake side? Can&#39;t figure it out. I canâ€™t figure out how it is more expensive than the ones we used to have. When I paid, my fingers were messed up. &quot;(Fang Yue Bi)&quot; is a cultural representative. The Mid-Autumn Festival is a traditional Chinese festival. The story tells the story of &quot;I&quot; in the Mid-Autumn Festival in the United States. The story is between the two cultures. The level is also very capable of grasping the story&#39;s narrative skills, mastering the appropriate rhythm. The suspense setting is not only at the beginning, but also indicates an unusual story, attracting readers&#39; interest in reading, and setting suspense in the process of storytelling. For example, in &quot;Awakening of Insomnia&quot;, the main protagonist of the story? The insomniac echoed by &quot;I&quot; disappeared and confusing, did not show up, and became a suspense from beginning to end. Telling stories and trying to make the story as exciting as possible is Yan Geling The problem that has always been concerned, in the later written &quot;Femao Host&quot;, the author has put the imagination to the extreme, through the mystery of Lao Chai, the mystery of the female landlord, suspense. The author is talking about creating this The origin of the novel is: &quot;That is, I saw a very nice and translucent woman&#39;s pajamas, just finished washing. Hanging in the bathroom, the wind blows it blows a corner on the road, I passed the road, foggy morning in San Francisco also has sun, the sun shines on the clothes, you can also see the drops. I feel very beautiful, very sexy and very sexy. Itâ€™s much more sexy than the womanâ€™s body in the clothes, and then I think if itâ€™s a homesick, very hungry, and very respectful of women, what do you think of a woman who appreciates a womanâ€™s pajamas? And it is a man with a very delicate heart. Then I wrote this story to an older male immigrant.&quot; A piece of pajamas caused this Mr. Zhu Ximing from Taiwan? The old critics in Taiwan called it a &quot;zero-defect novel&quot; and He won the first place in Taiwanâ€™s &quot;Central Daily News&quot; novel, and the author deliberately let the female room when describing the story.The east is hidden. Lao Chai was filled with tension in a kind of hope that she met her and worried about the situation with her. She was both nervous and mysterious. Lao Chai and the female landlord missed it several times, and finally met and met the power outage. The female landlord always wore a veil of confusing. Yan Ge&#39;s early short stories were mixed, some of which had a certain pattern tendency, the structure was evacuated, and the arbitrariness of the text was also large. Until recently, when writers wrote the &quot;Suizi series&quot;, the brushwork was more mature and the skills were more familiar.",movie
606,"Speaking of the most fascinating modern-themed military dramas in recent years, &quot;I am a special forces&quot; starring Liu Meng&#39;s original work, screenwriters and directors, Hou Yong and Xu Jia are absolutely classics. It is also because of its classics that this TV series quickly spawned two sequels, and after the second sequel, &quot;Special Soldiers&#39; Blades&quot;, the new third sequel, &quot;Special Soldiers&#39; Fire Phoenix&quot; is now landing. David sees that many of the special war fans and military fans &quot;like big and big rush&quot;, not only the ratings continue to be hot, but also caused a hot discussion on the Internet. In addition to the focus on the devil training of the female special warfare players, the most popular thing is that Xu Jia, who plays the &quot;two goods&quot; Lei Sangun and the &quot;mixed&quot; flamingo in the first two parts of the special forces, Nowadays, the daughter-in-law is finally a woman, and she has become the male No. 1 in this sequel. Moreover, Xu Jia and Hou Yong have become the only male protagonists who have appeared in the special forces trilogy. It is not difficult to see the director&#39;s love for these two actors. The theme of the third part is &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot;. The main story of the drama is the story of a group of fire phoenixes trained as a thunderbolt captain (Xu Jia ornaments). In the play, a rookie female soldier from different teams, different positions and military literacy is uneven. Among them are Tsinghua High-Quality Pvt. Ye Cunxin, physical team taekwondo master Shen Lanni, Lu Hang regiment sergeant A Zhuo, anti-chemical group anecdote class Tian Guo and Ouyang Qian, and even the cultural troupe Tang Xiaoxiao. The most hilarious thing is that the director also arranged a high-educated but no special soldier experience, but also a female instructor Tan Xiaolin and Lei Zhan in the battle against the thunder. It should be said that the biggest highlight of this drama is the Xu Jia who played the thunder! Compared with the &quot;old cannon&quot; in the first part and the &quot;mixed second generation&quot; in the second part, Xu Jia&#39;s drama is mixed with the old qualifications. This time, the incarnation of &quot;Raytheon&quot; is even more a form of instructor&#39;s death. Demon training for female soldiers? For example, let the female soldiers roll in the muddy pool, soak the water in the water, do one-hour push-ups, carry out 5 kilometers of armed cross-country, and also have to arm, etc., so that the drama Tan Xiaolin, the instructor who has been blind to the war, is very dissatisfied with the training method of the mine, and even accuses the headquarters of the brutal training method of the mine. But in fact, the mine war has his own reasons. Because of the sacrifice of his girlfriend Enron, he is particularly strict with the female soldier, which actually shows that there is a glass heart under the appearance of Tiehan. That is, he does not want these female special forces to repeat the same mistakes of their girlfriends, they can rely on their own toughness.Living, this is why he seems to be cold. Although the usual thunderbolt is very strong and very strict with the female soldiers, when the female soldiers discover his essence, they can&#39;t help but like the thunder. Because of this thundering war that people hate and love, the emotional drama in this &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot; of Tang is rich and colorful: first, the thunder war said that Ye Xiangxinâ€™s strength is like Enron, and Ye Yuanxin and Tan Xiaolin said that although Raytheon is very Strict, but admire him; later is Azhuo&#39;s secret love worship of the thunder, and finally Tan Xiaolin also fell in love with the thunder battle... So, the story of the three women in love with a man is really sad. And Xu Jia completely incarnates the man who has passed through the woman river, and plays a emotional scene with a number of heroines. It also allows the audience to see his exquisite acting and the delicate emotions behind the firmness of the iron man. From this point of view, director Liu Meng has always been addicted to Xu Jia in the special forces series, apparently seeing his potential. I believe that after the &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot;, Xu Jia, who is already able to stand alone, will star in more passionate military TV dramas, and create more classic images like Lei San Cannon, Flamingo and Raytheon.",movie
607,"On the Volga River in 1942, there is a history that cannot be forgotten. At the beginning of the film, the scene of the miserable riverside is summarized in extremely cool colors: the war is gray, and the dirty-faced soldiers are busy for the final defending sprint. Then, it was a very cruel and shocking war scene. After a few detonating explosions, the entire bank of the south bank of the river fell into a vast ocean fire, but this did not prevent the Soviet Red Army from assaulting. They still wore flames from the beach. The dead charge is on the battlefield. A great and brave soldier figure, they are sprinting and sprinting in the male fire without fear of sacrifice. Even if they can&#39;t live, they must die with the enemy. Compared with the Germans who have the wrong expression in the city gate, this group of faces Some of the warriors who canâ€™t see clearly are only brave and responsible; there are also the smog and the bright red flames that flutter from time to time; those great pictures show the manifestation of the sacred mission of the warriors. It is the cruel and ruthless visualization of war. That scene, both visual and psychological, gave the audience considerable shock, and this shock suddenly made me feel dignified. As a war-themed film, the grand and fierce war scenes created by Stalingrad, with panoramic warfare and local slow-motion details, are full of stunning images and intense wars. The bitter feelings brought. After a big scene of intense battles, the film is aimed at a great figure. At this time, the scene has the most remarkable features of the Russian war film. The description of the group image is the best of the Russian filmmakers, so it can faintly feel the taste of the &quot;ninth company&quot; or &quot;pot lid&quot;. Whether it is Gromov, Peter Kahn, Astahof, Polyakov, Chivanov, etc., or Kajia, Martha, two ordinary female citizens, in Fedor Under the fine lens of Dalchuk, it has become a touching element in the war. If you want to make the war more cruel and ruthless, it is obviously best to use the love between men and women. In the &quot;Staling&quot;, Fedor Bundarchuk moved from the beginning of the grand war scene to the local operations in several buildings in the city, in order to meticulously describe the touching love at both ends, and finally let the beautiful love story reflect the war. Cruel. At that time, Kajia, just turned 18 years old. As a flower girl, in that environment, the innocence and loyalty are always preserved. She swears to her homeland and faces the brave face of her deceased relatives. Let us see a woman.Sexual conviction that never gives up in the face of war and never compromises. It is also because of her courage and fearlessness that the five men around him have a good impression on them in desperation. They are acquainted with each other and succumb to their homeland. The pictures of your affection are constantly presented. At this time, we seem to be able to forget the guns and shells, quiet in the warmth and sweetness. The most touching scene is the romance created by five sentimental men on her 18th birthday, the cakes made with only the rest of the grain, the bathtubs that were carried back from the enemy bullets, and the men who have never spoken. The treble once again blessed the blessing... This scene is so sweet that it makes people feel sore inside. If there is no war, how good! Unlike Kajia, Martha is the heroine on the other line of love in the film, but she has entered a tragic plot from the beginning. From the beginning, with the forcedness of the German soldiers to the true love afterwards, let them bear the crime of swearing and prostitutes. In fact, every love story will appear in every war, although some distortions, but this proves the greatness of love without boundaries from the desperate situation of war! There is not much comedy conflict in the whole story. Under the background of the story of Stalingrad&#39;s defending war, the humanity&#39;s light and the power of love are very steadily displayed, and the cruelty of the whole war is highlighted from the emotions of a living little person. Although the 3D effects of the film are inferior to those of the main visuals, the effect is quite good in the opening scene of the big lens war and the heroine watching the sky in the attic. In general, some of the literary &quot;Stalingrad&quot; is a great work worth seeing!",movie
608,"In 1942, on the battlefield of Stalingrad, the Soviets and the Soviets stood across the Volga River. After the Soviets tried to recapture the offensive operations on the beachfront of the river, the scattered Soviet troops retreated to the heroine Kajiaâ€™s home. The strength of the stock continues to resist the German army, and the story begins. The film is named &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, but compared with the famous tragic battle of the world, it is only used as the background of the story, and there is not much to show the Soviet Union. The tactical strategic scene of the large-scale battle between the German and German armies, and the main point of view fell in a building on the Volga River. The battle scenes were mostly dominated by the melee fighting, so this war history film went more. The route of the literary film. For the audience of military fans who want to watch the epic poems of the grand war, the film&#39;s pattern is slightly smaller, and the viewing experience may feel less enjoyable. In my personal feeling, the film is actually more like a book. The story is finished. The process is full of oppressive and heavy emotional accumulation, leaving everything that is to be expressed to the audience. Recalling and reflecting after reading... Honor? The German sergeant with great honor is almost a model of a good soldier: heroic and courageous, fearless, always at the forefront. The war in his eyes is more like a competitive game of courage and ability. He wants to win, but also wins beautiful, wins brilliance, and wins the opponent&#39;s conviction. The Russian soldiers in his mouth &quot;have no sense of honor, only black guns, and fight for revenge. You guys are not worthy to fight with me!&quot; In fact, the amnesty of the Russian army is just inconsistent with the values â€‹â€‹he holds. Hehe. The Russian army slammed against snipers in non-combat time to shoot German soldiers who were fighting for water. They also realized that the presence of the heroine would make the soldiers emotionally overwhelm and tried to persuade her to leave. Revenge? Actually, the Russian army slammed the attack on the innocent civilians after witnessing the brutal death of the Germans. The German army has always looked down on the Russian army for revenge. After the woman who cares about it was shot, she resolutely turned the final offense into a revenge of personal grievances. Holding a huge weapon advantage of a tank battalion, he could directly razed the building to the ground, but he chose the assault attack after the shelling, and rushed into the room like a madman to find the Russian army and wanted to complete the swordsman style. Duel. In tactical strategy, rational use can be closer to winning at the least cost. But the war can make all of themThe person in the middle, loses reason and loses the principle. Survival? Innocent civilians are the biggest victims of the war. They are irresistibly involved in them, displaced and displaced. To live, it has become the humblest and only remaining belief. Sacrificing? Obeying the command is the duty of the military. Once you join the battlefield, it means contributing everything, including life, to complete the execution of the order. Unlike civilians, survival is a thing that can be lost at any time for military personnel. War? What is war? The war was a building on the Volga River. The Soviet and German troops left countless bodies for the battle. In the end, no one could get the building. Quote a line in the film for the end?? Thanks to our fathers, let us still do not know what war is.",movie
609,"Unlike the general viewing experience, all the viewing experience is abolished when watching this film. It is unexpected and unexpected. Although the performance is deliberately exaggerated, it is quite compatible with the style of the whole film. I am thinking about what the director wants to say? What is the intention? It seems that he is talking about what is called justice. Justice is not the apparent justice. It is not to help the disadvantaged group or justice. It is not the poor people with low social status who have justice. The evil is not helping others to lift the relationship between mother and daughter. Covering the facts is evil, whoever wins is just, and lawyers are people who are not gods. From this tone, this film is very realistic and cruel. However, this conclusion seems to be unreasonable. If the director thinks this way, why should he arrange the stupid girl who has always appeared in the image of justice incarnation? It is certainly not to be defeated and ugly. Gumeimen used to be ordinary. The most annoying old people don&#39;t even want to go bankrupt. Although the reality is cruel, maybe we can move on with the dream of fighting for justice. I really couldn&#39;t vomit for the ending, so that my husband and I couldn&#39;t stop screaming after reading it. Director, how can you let me just shed tears and find myself being cheated, thinking that I have to be fooled when I see the story behind the two people&#39;s grudges. Is the director standing in the corner with a smile and saying: &quot;I was cheated again, it was a fool.&quot;",movie
610,"According to historical records, the Red Army, who participated in the Battle of Stalingrad, had an average survival time of no more than 24 hours. What kind of sacrifice was this. And a small team in this film resists the Red Army. It is undoubtedly the epitome of millions of soldiers in that year. The arms are complete, but they all sacrificed to protect the country. The most eye-catching girl in the film, Kajia? Uncle&#39;s mother became the incarnation of the Mother Earth and comforted several soldiers who fought bloody battles. Of course, don&#39;t think that I have said before that the rescue uncle is telling the story of his &quot;five dads&quot; and doubting the purity of the five women and one man. It turns out that only one of the five is the rescue uncle. Father, but which one is, is undoubtedly a big suspense in the story line of this film. A Russian film like &quot;Stalingrad&quot; was so commercial, not only has a huge war scene, but also the bombing bridge, and in the story, it is close to a lot of commercial blockbusters that once sold. For example, the scenes of several big soldiers who succumb to the small building are very similar to the &quot;assembly&quot;, the multiple sniper-type shootings of the sniper of the army, and the &quot;small squad&quot;, of course, the warriors and women in the war, the Hollywood blockbuster A lot, too many to mention, will not repeat them. The film also made a lot of effort in the details. Whether it is the main actors of the Red Army camp or the senior officials of the German army, they are all shaped into flesh and blood. Originally, war is the tragedy of human beings, whether it is a party of justice or a preparation. The condemned party, as a member of the war, has no right or ability to escape. In the end, I praised the oil painting-like quality, and let this group of Russian rough men flash a different kind of tough guy style. The platform squats and looks down, they are too far away from them. Learn more, say Unexpectedly, the teacherâ€™s long skills to control things will come in handy.",movie
611,"&quot;The Enemy&quot; director called Fuxi, especially the high-end ancient name, in fact, he is a new director, screenwriter, the script &quot;Conspiracy&quot; he created many years ago, was bought and bought by the 20th century Fox Studios in the United States. Next, it is a very telling director, so the story of &quot;The Avengers&quot; also tells too many differences. &quot;The Enemy&quot; is a story about revenge for revenge. A triad, Fan Shaohuang, who was in prison and a father who lost his loved one, was linked because of a rape case. Not only that, but because of his deliberation Wu Zhenyu, who wants to slap the criminals, was in the first moment of Fan Shaohuangâ€™s release from prison. He followed Fan Shaohuangâ€™s side in the form of renting a chartered car. Of course, this is a big suspense of the film story. The battlefield is arrogant and will definitely affect everyone. The degree of suspense in the process of watching movies, but the focus of this film is not here. As a mainland director, Fu Xi uses the lineup of &quot;Galaxy Image&quot; to fill this work, whether it is Wu Zhenyu or Lin Xue. They are all the actor of Johnnie To, and Fan Shaohuang is also the backbone of many Hong Kong films. This neat lineup, together with the camera Huang Yuetai, is a simple way to make a traditional Hong Kong underworld film. However, it is obvious that the director does not take the usual path and wants to be a revenge movie of &quot;anti-river lake&quot; and &quot;anti-underworld&quot;. &quot;The anti-river lake&quot; is also in Hong Kong. The &quot;Jianghu Express&quot; starring Liang Jiahui is one, the film is derailed, and the brothers are in the same situation. All these kinds are very different from our common rivers and lakes, especially Liang Jiahui plays. The singer of the rivers and lakes was impressed by the solo dance of the September 1st in the red dress. This kind of playful and exaggerated &quot;reverse&quot;, while the story of &quot;The Enemy&quot; leads the story to the incomparable In the dark, with a &quot;dark day&quot; approach to packaging such a seemingly simple but intricate revenge story. At the same time as the story is extended, there is a ruthless irony and exposure to the loyalty of the underworld that we once deeply aspire to. Seeing more heroes&#39; series of heroes, as well as the series of young and old, can outline a river and lake society for us. Brothers are big brothers, big brothers love brothers, have wine to drink together, have hatred to report, big brother woman Can not touch, they will be killed when they touched... Too much too much, the result of &quot;The Enemy&quot; is uncharacteristic, from the pursuit of Zhang Jinyi played by Fan Shaohuang, there are many clues. At the beginning of the movie, Zhang Jin was confessed to being the best brother of the big brother, seduce the big brother, and shared the good things, oneThe man of the rivers and lakes, even the thick makeup and the big bangs playing SM, is also hard to find, the most amazing thing is that the rape is exposed, the woman is still there, the brother is still alive, this is incredible in the past, the underworld is dirty, the situation As for this, it is not unreasonable. Zhang Jin is also not a good class. Even if he is chased, it is also the end of the Buddhaâ€™s livelihood. However, since the film is called &quot;The Enemy&quot;, it is necessary to talk about another protagonist, Yang Yan, a taxi driver played by Wu Zhenyu. This is a role that bears the burden of humiliation and mentality, and looks for the Chinese performing arts circle. To the second actor who is more suitable than Wu Zhenyu, the feeling of being determined to die in the dead, and the cold is so cold. Speaking of Wu Zhenyu, it is necessary to explain the general story of the film: Wu Zhenyu has a lovely daughter. As a result, one day, he was defamed by the underworld and raped by the underworld brother. This eldest brother is Fan Shaohuangâ€™s eldest brother? Fan Shaohuang was an accomplice at the scene. Although there was no time for rape, he was imprisoned for three years because he was forced to be a big brother. After the girl suffered misfortune, she was unhappy and committed suicide on a certain day. The mother also left her father Wu Zhenyu, causing the man who died this wife to embark on the road of revenge for hateful brothers. There may be an interviewer who will ask, this plot, there is nothing curious, why should we say that this is an &quot;anti&quot; Jianghu film? It is because Fan Shaohuang and Wu Zhenyu have two enemies. When there is always a true face, when Wu Zhenyu holds the gun to be fired, the holy light that appears in an instant dilutes the impulse to attack the enemy. Perhaps it is more humanistic and more reflective than the many slogans in the Hong Kong film that complained and complained.",movie
612,"Sandberg mentioned in the book that women in the United States have a higher proportion of undergraduate and graduate graduates, but women in the top management or government officials are rare. I believe that it is no exception in the world. I have to sigh that this is a regrettable fact. I am very touched by the words of Deboraspa, Dean of Barnard College. She said that the purpose of all the efforts we have made is not to make us feel guilty, or to push us to endless competition and compare children. Better, who is more stable or who is working longer; its purpose is to make us feel free? Not only do we have the freedom to choose, but we don&#39;t always feel that we made a mistake when making these choices. To obtain true freedom, not only the transformation of the traditional concept of the whole society, but also the need to break the inner obstacles, courageously sit at the table, fight for promotion, express opinions and harvest. Here we encourage female compatriots to be proactive, call on families to give us more support, and appeal to the society to provide us with more understanding and opportunities. It is not entirely due to the feminist freedom and liberation pursued by feminists, but also A more equitable environment and a more progressive world Of course, the value of a woman is not in what position she has done, how much money she has earned, how many children have been born, but as a living individual, whether she has a full and abundance of life.",movie

614,"Fedor Bundarchuk is not the first time to participate in the film creation of the Battle of Stalin Green. When the Soviet Union still existed, he participated in a movie called &quot;The Stalingrad Blood&quot;, and the time passed, the Soviet Union After the smog, Gorbachev was replaced by Putin, and Bondarchuk also took out the IMAX3D version of Stalingrad. Bondarchuk was born into a family of films. His father Sergei Bangdarchuk is a famous film artist who has compiled, directed and played in a world of humming, and Laobangâ€™s self-directed and epic masterpiece &quot;War and &quot;Peace&quot; has won the Oscar for the best foreign language film. This time, the small state&#39;s &quot;Stalingrad&quot; on behalf of Russia to compete for Oscar, is also a piece of film father and son. Inheriting the style of the father, Fedor Bundarchuk is also a editor, director, and performer, and is passionate about military and historical themes. In 2005, he directed and performed the &quot;ninth company&quot;, reflecting the Soviet invasion. The history of Afghanistan (the Afghan war can be called the &quot;Vietnam War&quot; of the Soviet Union) set a new record for the Russian box office. This &quot;Stalingrad&quot; has a lot of &quot;ninth company&quot; in the whole narrative mode? With a grassroots squad as the protagonist, it focuses on depicting the cruelty of the strangulation, even the soldiers and the same girl. Emotional entanglements can be found in the Ninth Connection. However, it is a breakthrough in itself to be able to point the angle of view only to civilians, ordinary soldiers and middle and lower-level officers. In the history of Soviet-Russian movies, whenever the Battle of Stalingrad was mentioned, Stalin, Zhukov, Cui Kefu, Hitler, and Paulus were indispensable for the commanders and officers of the two sides. Even the Germansâ€™ &quot;Decision of Stalingrad&quot; was impossible. And Bondalchuk, the Stalingrad, the highest-ranking officer in the film is a German colonel, which can be described as a complete retelling of this bloody battle from a civilian perspective. The filmâ€™s ingenuity began in Japan, when a major earthquake struck. A Russian rescuer told his family that he had â€œfive fathersâ€ in order to cheer up the wounded under the rubble. His mother was Stalin. From her perspective, Kay, a little girl in the Battle of GÃ¶ll, began a struggle with Stalingrad around a house... I got rid of the historical interpretation of the monopoly of Bolshevism, the Bondalchuk guide The next &quot;Stalingrad&quot; uses the ingenious narrative to communicate with the audience of the new generation, and there is no lack of humanity entanglement and condolence. Those Stalingrad citizens who cannot be evacuatedDalin ordered that it should not be evacuated. It is not as clear as we imagined. They shuttled between the fire lines of the Soviets and the Soviets and struggled to survive. They were already numb by gunfire and too lazy to go (Kaga is like this). There are also cowards in the Red Army. The officers will smash him without saying anything. The German soldiers who killed the Red Army soldiers and fetched water are not &quot;high&quot; (so they were reprimanded by the Red Army officers, and even the Nazi officers slammed the Red Army without &quot;honor&quot;. sense&quot;). Clay Schumann, who played the Nazi officer in the German version of the &quot;Decisive Battle of Stalingrad&quot;, &quot;has returned to the old business&quot;. His Nazi officer Kahn began to be fascinated by a Russian beauty who looks like her wife. He is raped. She, but protect her, so Kahn and her have a complex and tangled emotions?? The beauty was finally shot by the Red Army sniper as a German shot, Kahn also screamed at the sky Destroy the human war? This is with Nanjing! Nanjing! The Japanese soldier Kadokawa formed a secret echo, and Kahnâ€™s final suicide charge was the same as Kakugawaâ€™s suicide, and the two characters also highlighted the anti-fascist meaning of the two films. Putin has quoted a Russian buzzword more than once on many occasions: &quot;Whoever wants to go back to the past, there is no mind; whoever does not miss the past, there is no conscience.&quot; With the 180-degree turn of ideology, The Russian peopleâ€™s view of history has also suffered a shock, but history cannot be denied. From the perspective of Stalingrad, Bondarchuk neither used the history of the Soviet Union to deny the history of the former Soviet Union, nor used the history of the former Soviet Union to negate the Soviet Union. Post-history? History is written by the people. Victory belongs to civilian heroes. In the face of this war, the invaded Soviet soldiers and civilians were victims, and the German soldiers who were shackled by fascists were also victims. In short, in the balance between mind and conscience, Stalingrad presents an audio-visual feast and a bloody song with oil painting. Of course, as a blockbuster with Western capital intervention, Stalingrad also reached a communication with the Western-style â€œuniversal valueâ€ on the level of â€œanti-fascismâ€, and as a Russian director, created a commercial blockbuster. Naturally, it is impossible to exaggerate the individual heroism of the Red Army soldiers. The plot of some lonely heroes may make the audience feel &quot;dog blood&quot;, but in my opinion, for a heroic hymn, this A little exaggeration can be understood. Max Weber once sighed that today&#39;s art &quot;Qing Qing, I am more than angry, but not enough&quot;When the theater is full of &quot;chicken movies&quot; and urban love themes, &quot;Stalingrad&quot; gives us a deep, thick and broad epic tragic beauty, which makes the screen more beautiful. &quot;The pride.&quot; Its mountain stone can be used to attack jade. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; undoubtedly has great reference significance for China&#39;s modern history military film. The Soviet-Russian War has been playing for four years, and there are so many excellent film and television works; we hit eight In the year of the Anti-Japanese War, what are the film and television works that have left the shadow in the world of film? Perhaps, in the face of history, give up the preaching voice, keep a clear mind, uphold the sincere conscience, and add a little commercial &quot;dog blood&quot;, we can have our modern war history blockbuster.

618,"Before the film was seen, the news that Stalingrad will be released has already produced an inspiring effect. Its significance is to make up for the lack of two aspects: First, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, our information about Russian movies. There are very few, and the introduction of this film reminds us of the classic Soviet films in history and the commonality between Chinese films and Soviet films. Second, since the beginning of the new century, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and &quot;Black Hawk&quot; After Fall, Hollywood sci-fi blockbusters began to occupy the screen on a large scale. The future space war replaced the real human war. The traditional war film was comprehensive, and the 3D-made &quot;Stalingrad&quot; allowed us to see the combination of historical warfare and advanced technology. Prospects. Nevertheless, when we actually saw the film, we found that it still had a certain gap with the masterpieces of the Soviet Union during the New Wave of the 1950s and 1960s. The rich poetic and compassionate reflection traditions in &quot;The Forty-first&quot;, &quot;Song of the Soldier&quot;, &quot;Ivan&#39;s Childhood&quot; and other films, although there is a certain degree of reflection in &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, but no further Beyond, the strength of its narratives and themes is also largely eroded by commercial purposes. From both internal and external observations, we can see the innovations in the current creation of war films and the dilemmas still facing them. War film is one of the most important types in the history of film. Its value exists in the support of the historical form of war on the artistic carrier of film. First of all, the history of human civilization itself is a history of war, and the war provides a rich and continuous source of material for the film. Secondly, the humanity exposed in the life and death state of the war is very complicated. Examining it can enhance the depth of the film. Once again, the fierce war scenes prepare conditions for the film to create audiovisual spectacle. After World War II, the world&#39;s war film creation reached its climax. After long-term accumulation, many types of styles have been formed, such as battle films, prisoners of war, thrillers, heroes, and other biographies. They all have their own mature and distinct routines. However, in today&#39;s relatively peaceful era, the war film encountered an unprecedented dilemma: on the one hand, in the environment of entertainment to death, it is difficult to gain viewer interest as a war film that renders cruel texture and destruction. The war can&#39;t find in memory. To the impression, people can&#39;t make emotional projections; on the other hand, it is the bottleneck of the creation of the war film itself. Whether it is to promote the spirit of heroism or to express the anti-war theme, it is difficult to see new things on the narrative level. So the current war film began to yield to entertainment.There has been a trend of some kind of hodgepodge?? Disguise yourself as a background for entertainment narratives or some kind of shackles and elements, such as &quot;Golden Robbery&quot;, &quot;Kitchen Dice&quot; and other movies, all close to war The relationship, but not the war film. In contrast, &quot;Stalingrad&quot; is undoubtedly a war film in a strict sense. Its direct display of the war process, the revealing of human nature, and the praise of heroism are typical elements of war film. But there have been four films about the most tragic battles in World War II. Some have created an epic atmosphere from a macro perspective, and some have told legends from a microscopic perspective. Therefore, &quot;Stalingrad&quot; does not have any new ideas in its subject matter, and its breakthrough can only be based on technology, that is, the gimmick of creating visual wonders. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; started from the local, through the contest between two hostile squads in a few days, and the shaping of several characters, from the side to see the tragic war. &quot;Stalingrad&quot; is not only a geographical coordinate and a historical event in the film, but also a symbol of the human phenomenon of &quot;war&quot;. It makes sense to put the story in the film in the context of any battle. The conflict of the story lies in the possession and robbing of a house. The Soviet armyâ€™s major counterattack failed. Only a few scouts entered the city and occupied a building. The German captain Kahan, who had guarded the building, was ordered to retake the building. With this core goal, the movie can sit down and talk about love. It spreads two emotional clues on the plot: one is the love story between the six Soviet soldiers and the only girl left in the building, Kajia; the other is the lust between Kahn and the Russian girl Martha in the enemy-occupied area. entanglement. In the parallel narrative, the film alternates the emotional development of the two parties, and joins a battle scene. After several times of sawing, the contradiction will surely reach its zenith, and the final solution is the climax of the film. Because the performance of the film in the literary part of the game is somewhat dragged, the sensation of the perception is not great, only when the battle is over, can the spirit be brought forward. In these two clues, the author&#39;s position can be clearly seen. The emotion between the Soviets and Kajia was shaped as a positive form. Kajiaâ€™s insistence on his homeland, the soldierâ€™s love for Kajia, and the adventure for her to prepare a birthday present all showed a sacred light. In contrast, Kahn and Martha&#39;s emotions are much darker. This is the physical possession of an aggressor and the physical dependence of the aggressor. Martha vs. KahnAcceptance is hard to say because of fear, or really like it. On the surface, the two stories show the contrast of love/sex, light/darkness, innocence/dirty, alive/death, and the audience will naturally be touched by the former, but from the perspective of humanity, the strength of the latter is To be stronger than the former, Kahnâ€™s thoughts on his hometown and his doubts about the war made us see the damage that the war has caused to both sides, and Marthaâ€™s behavior is understandable in the face of the demands of survival. Of course, the film also expressed the rethinking of the Great Patriotic War through the words of Soviet soldiers. The Soviet captain Gromov worried that his men were not fighting for the motherland and Stalin, but fighting for a woman. When he realized the problem, it just showed that his mind was awake. When he understood the absurdity of this war, he did not resist, but continued to carry out his mission, and at the last moment he destroyed the enemy with self-sacrifice, which is even more a tragedy. In fact, why the Battle of Stalingrad lasted for such a long time, causing such a large number of casualties, and the spiritual contest between Hitler and Stalin was inseparable. Stalin must not allow this city named after him to be occupied by the Germans, so he ordered the troops to hold every inch of the land in their feet, and if they retreat, they would immediately shoot. Therefore, the Soviet squad in the film, despite facing the enemy and my weak encirclement, resolutely accepted the orders of the superiors. Hitler also insisted on using this battle to destroy the Soviet will. Even if the situation of the later changes changed, he ordered the troops to take down Stalingrad and missed many opportunities for breakthrough and peripheral operations, resulting in the final failure. Although the film does not emphasize this point, but from a plot, we can see the conscious conscious metaphor. Kahn gathered his troops to mobilize before the war. He said that God is with us, and that Hitler is God, just beside us. But in the picture, we clearly saw that the wall behind the troops happened to be Stalin&#39;s giant statue. This meaningful composition shows the injustice of the nature of war. War is a continuation of politics, a game of power-makers, and the army is nothing more than a chess piece, which is the footnote of &quot;the bones are dry.&quot; When the audience sees this plot, they will make a smile, and the effect of the film will be achieved. The ending of Stalingrad is a typical commercial narrative model. Just like a police film or a western movie, the heads of the opposing sides must meet and make a final duel. Kahn and Gromov are in the filmIn the attic, while pulling up the gun, both shot. (This kind of situation has long been commonplace in Hong Kong gangsters such as &quot;The True Color of Heroes&quot; and &quot;The Bloody Heroes&quot;. Even in Wu Yusen&#39;s &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, Zhou Yu and Cao Cao are also arranged to conduct direct sword contests.) The protagonist must be The last one fell. When the guns passed, the dust buried everything, leaving only the girl on the opposite tower, leaving last hope for life. However, during the filming process, I have made another final setting for the film: Kajia and Martha were sent to this unmanned tower by their own men. When the battle was in progress, Martha Step On the upper floor, I met with Kajia upstairs. When the four eyes are opposite, what are the feelings of these two women belonging to men in different camps? Such an ending may convey a richer and deeper meaning. But unfortunately, the film allowed the Soviet sniper to end Martha&#39;s life with a shot, complete a complete and closed narrative, and end a more open end. This is the distance between business and art. Perhaps only one step or one line interval is the setting of life and death. The war film is a kind of action film. When expressing the war scene, there are two ways of freehand and realistic. The restoration of the war scene by &quot;Stalingrad&quot; is a combination of these two methods. From the very beginning, the film has revealed the urban appearance of Stalingrad from a macro perspective. This is not like the environment in which people can live, but the appearance of hell. The wreckage was everywhere, the fire was still spreading, and the whole city was filled with a gray-black dense fog. The audience seemed to be able to smell the strong smell of gunpowder and the taste of death. This kind of tragic scene like oil painting first set a tone for the story. In this environment, everything happens abnormally and normal. In terms of details, we clearly saw the piano, books, rag dolls and other objects contaminated by cannon fodder, which hinted at the life before the war, and also criticized the destructiveness of war. In the performance of the battle scene, the film uses sound, lens, props and other elements to render a real, fierce battle state, the audience&#39;s heart is lifted to the eyes, there is a dry mouth feeling. The film uses the slow-motion processing method to decompose the action of the fighting characters into visible images. In the combination of motion and static, the process from birth to death is recorded. But at the same time, this method also makes people&#39;s movements look awkward, and the image is somewhat stagnant, just like the inferior game screen on the computer, it looks mechanical. Film and beautyThe cooperation of IMAX companies and the 3D technology production team of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Hobbit Adventures&quot; have fundamentally guaranteed the level of audio-visual effects. Therefore, it is difficult to say that its box office victory is a victory for Russian films or a victory for Hollywood. However, compared to sci-fi blockbusters such as monsters and robots, this kind of imagery from the depths of history and rooted in the land does give people a different look and feel. However, while science and technology can restore the war, it may also exaggerate its tragic level. This standard is difficult to grasp. Therefore, after all, movies are movies, and there will always be a gap between reality and reality. In general, in the current decline of traditional war films, the success of Stalingrad at least injected a stimulant into this type of creation. Even if we don&#39;t have a personal experience of war, we will be afraid of it when we see the image. Peace is by no means a slogan. It needs to be pursued and adhered to forever. Since there are not many new things in narratives and themes, Stalingrad has not solved the dilemma of war film creation. We also need to see if other works in the follow-up are better expressed.

In the Russian national level, Fedor Bundarchuk directed &quot;Stalingrad&quot; to bring out the aesthetics of the Russian war film. The historical background of the film need not be said. Everyone knows the fierce battle of Stalingrad. The size, importance, and the film depicting this battle have also taken many parts before and after. For now, this one is the best one.

The Russian army attacked the German position. After the oil tank exploded, the entire front line was swallowed by the sea of â€‹â€‹fire. The Russian soldiers were all in front of the fire, and the oil-like scenes rushed with great spirit. Power, the German army burned people to induce the Russian army to rush out of the house, the bloody battle, bloody table. What is even more memorable is the â€œloveâ€ between the Russian girl and the soldiers. A piece of soap, homemade candles and cakes, a bath filled with hot water, a tenor sing, these emotional details Let this war have a life and let sacrifice have meaning. The production of the film represents the highest level of production in the world of cinema. The creative aspect is of course the Russian team&#39;s masterpiece. The technical support of Hollywood ensures that the IMAX-3D picture quality is impeccable, no matter the huge explosion scene, the vast battlefield. Ruins, indoor scenes, every painting, a book, a piece of jewelry, each person&#39;s styling, costumes and make-up, all exquisitely impressive, ensuring that the audience can be as big as the immersive screen The most realistic pictures, props and fine arts have made it impossible for all the movies in China to be called large movies. a nation that is the most bloody and artistic foundation of the EarthThe Russian war film is more exciting than any movie in any country.

624,"After reading &quot;Exile&quot;, some people may have such a question: The original class has been recalled. Under the same background, why is &quot;Exile&quot; reopening a story? Does it directly extend the story of the previous &quot;Gun Fire&quot;? A letter fled to Macao after his death, and after a few years he became a family there, and he also had children. Wenge is overworked because of his age. Nan Ge took over his business, but after all, because of the lack of backing, Nan Ge is not as smooth in Hong Kong. So he came to Macau with his community. When he was in Macau, he met Axin. He remembered that this was the man who was going to kill the big brother many years ago. Now he is still alive. When South Korea is about to kill him, he is countered by his vigilant first, and his chest is bulleted. Nan Ge vowed to kill Ashin. He also remembered that this was the task he had delivered to the Ghost. In order to regain his prestige, he now insisted that the Ghosts kill Ashin personally. After the last mission, A Fei admired the ghosts because of Ashin&#39;s business, and followed the ghosts again. Amy was already dead because of the already loyal Wenge, and he simply followed Ah Lai. When Alai learned that A Ghost was going to kill Ashin, he first found Ashin and protected Ashin. This paragraph is the story of the seven years in the middle of the two films. Well, since the two films clearly can be connected back and forth, why do all the old people have to pay a new name for the old ones? Directly called &quot;gun fire 2&quot;, is it better to recall the audience&#39;s memories? And I haven&#39;t seen the first one, and it doesn&#39;t affect them to see this sequel. Because at the time, Du Qifeng was in the process of convening the original class, only Lu Yixianâ€™s schedule had some problems. So I had to find Zhang Jiahui to replace his position. However, since it was changed to let Zhang Jiahui play, Ashin could not call Axin, and once there was no Ashin, there would be no Alai, no Ghost, Afei, Amai and Anan. Itâ€™s no problem just to change your name. The only regret is that the protagonists did die in the end, so the story ended completely. However, the background of the film is the eve of Macao&#39;s return, and it is also the 99th year of the event, so we can see it as another story of the five-person group in parallel time and space. In the parallel time and space, they have deep hands and feet and help each other. I think of the words that Shen Jiayi said when he called Ke Jingteng under the night sky. &quot;They are really happy in parallel time and space!&quot; The series often has a sequel. But still expect them to be in the next new parallelIn time and space, re-interpretation of a new blood story.",movie
625,"Before evaluating the film, please allow me to express my love for Miss Xie Yilinâ€™s almost fanatical second love. A few months ago, &quot;Little Times&quot; was the first time I watched her big screen show. Now think about it, I think the film wastes her and becomes a machine that only talks about jokes and rolling eyes. At that time, I looked at her acting skills, thinking that it was just a coincidence that the lines were all happy, and that they all needed a sly expression to have an excellent smile. But in &quot;I am a blind date&quot;, thanks to MM&#39;s versatile costumes and exaggerated manners, overflowing with rich emotions and every comedy cell that shines brightly, I can&#39;t help myself with my heart. I love her a movie in the supermarket, watching the aunts around me applaud, the pride of my heart is full of faces, not playing acoustic guitar, not giving roses, the simple sprout of love, this artistic conception Too innocent. Don&#39;t laugh, but it does touch my tears here. She did not move a few pieces of back muscles in &quot;Little Age&quot;. &quot;Chinese&quot; is a bit overdone. Although &quot;Blind&quot; is a neutral person, I can concentrate on her expression. When she pouted, her eyes twitched with a half-happiness. When she shook her head, the fat on her face shook slightly. When she laughed, the two wiping lines shrank a lovely curvature... I confident that the aesthetics of the opposite sex are enough for the public. However, there is absolutely no resilience to this. In the romantic comedy where the prostitute female temperament female sensation is larger than the Chinese leftover female, I am unreasonably and actually captured. Thanks to MM&#39;s eye-catching level, she completely compared the female No. 1 Han Xue. In the three love lines of the film, Han Xueâ€™s bones are loved and we are used to it. The line of literary and female women is too short. The actress Fan Yulin is not enough. Only hold the sister really hold my eyes and heartbeat. After expressing my love, come back and talk about the movie itself. I really like the way the movie opens. There aren&#39;t a lot of subtitles introduced. No characters are narrating &quot;Who am I, what I do, what personality&quot;, but it will tell you all that sooner or later. The Scouts will not introduce him as a hospital administrator. When we see him dealing with the best doctors, the outbreak of the storm is over, and the profession is clear at a glance. Jiang Xiaoyu does not mention his life, but don&#39;t worry, the unique blind date meets, there are opportunities for him to chatter about self-introduction, and you will not be disgusted. I have always believed that the role of the film introduction is like a blind date with the audience. It is necessary to gradually build up understanding in intimate interactions, instead of arbitrarily putting information out like the prisoners being tried. Han Xue debutThat scene explains everything, only the unreasonable Bone Bone will use this trick to see each other and see what she is recruiting (covering it). Only the screenwriters who don&#39;t understand the audience&#39;s psychology will use the most mediocre opening, and &quot;Blind&quot; is enough to give them a lesson. There are also some places in the film where there is no reason. For example, how does Zhao Shuai come up with a slow city idea, such as å•¾å•¾ easily forgiving the Scout who peeked at the diary (in fact, this is a place I canâ€™t bear, big men peek at the little girlâ€™s birthday This is a crime of playing five thunders in the sky. It is also incredible that the advertisements of the matchmaking advertisements are in all directions (of course, if he is missing, more than half of the stories will not be round). At the same time, it is very contradictory that I am very grateful to the story to maintain this ambiguous ambiguity, and love at first sight, no reason, follow the guidance of the heart, and do not need too much hardship love dreams, this æœ¦èƒ§ really fits. Let us temporarily stay away from the sad world of Romeo and Juliet, and let Romeo&#39;s pursuit of love also fail. In this strange world, the god of love is more generous than anywhere else. Parents did not act as obsessive lover, they are a group of charitable elders who are helping others. The ancient exegesis of the door-to-door pair quietly exudes magic, rich second generation and white bones, Tuen Mun men and women, technical houses and literary women (programming men with beautiful women writers, highly matched life style, completely a model of harmonious marriage), show The market competition of urban love jungle, the law of attraction of natural selection, but also very inspirational: no matter how many you are, how shy, how noble and arrogant, more absent-minded, in the face of love, everyone is equal. Don&#39;t use Cupid to shoot the string of arrows, don&#39;t use the old man to pull out the red line, the person on the apex, she will ride a bicycle, separate the crowd like Moses from the Red Sea, come to you. &quot;Dating&quot; is the popular &quot;multi-line love comedy&quot; route. There is no heartlessness in the world. There is no big joy and sadness in Ye Nianzhen. There is no such thing as Chen Guohuiâ€™s Xia Yongkangâ€™s circumstance, the color of fairy tales, the atmosphere of sitcom. And one of the characters like the one from the four-character comics, composed a symphony of positive energy surrounding love. The only sorrow, just let my nose a bit sour, was ruined by a group of two goods pushed into the toilet (daring suggestion, if you arrange a girl who lost love and the doctor to make a little spark, will it make people believe in love more )). The audience and the characters in the story are the grass mud horses smirking on the neck, bowing their heads and eating the sweet spirit of the grass, and the heart is full of love fragrance.",movie

627,"Love, the eternal theme of humanity, can be a tragedy like &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, or it can be a happy ending in the entanglement like this film. The audience likes a perfect love. The feelings in reality are many. Shun, the story of finding truth, goodness and beauty in art works can be regarded as a minimum of people&#39;s sustenance. After all, the best love is that men and women love to enjoy, so this film is very suitable for couples to watch together. The only danger is that girlfriend may Go find a guide as a boyfriend. The French have always been famous for their romance. This film is also a proper reflection of the romantic feelings of the French people who are not reliable. The Westerners are also superstitious. They believe in the story of family curses. The idea of â€‹â€‹getting married and divorcing is enough. Reliable, even if you can&#39;t count on a recurring plan, you can find someone to lie to you. It can be counterproductive. This unfortunate hapless child makes the heroine hurt his mind, but no matter how to torture this marriage of erroneous yang, it really does not leave. Do not give up the strength, the official strength of this genius to let the actor finally hold the beauty. The film gives the impression of a road film. In Kenya and Russia and the landscape of Paris, love also has a magical chemical reaction due to different regions. The ridiculous things happening in the journey are the embellishments of love. Itâ€™s hard to believe that such a story happens to Chinese or Americans, but the two main characters in French make it all right, and the story is fully grasped in different regions. The local essence, the customs of the black tribes, the Russian national dance, and the French people&#39;s sense of well-being are just exaggerated but not distorted. This is an interesting film. The French have reason to sneer at Hollywood. After all, their own cultural tastes satisfy their own cultural life for their own people. Hollywoodâ€™s local tyrants are best suited for big-name successors, Europeans. The cultural heritage guarantees its cultural taste, even if it is a comedy, it can be just right to make people laugh.",movie

The heroine is more and more horrified, and the naked appearance is too shocking. Children are not suitable. The male neurotic acting is too good!

630,"I have always had a tangled thing in my heart. I don&#39;t like Japan. I don&#39;t have any special feelings for the Japanese. But Japanese culture has a very strong appeal to me. I like Japanese anime at first, then Japanese literature. Later, Going to Japanese movies and Japanese TV shows, there are indeed factors that are very attractive to me. This contradictory feeling has nowhere to be reconciled, so I want to see how the pro-Japanese faction of that year viewed Japan. I came to learn. However, after reading it, I feel that Mr. Dai Jitao is a politician. In the judgment of politicians, there is really no right or wrong. They will weigh the interests of all parties and then make judgments that maximize profits. There are no friends forever, nor forever. The enemy, in the eyes of politicians, Japan is indeed another country, but it belongs to the colored people from the ethnic division, so it is a force that can be united to fight against white people. This is the view of some pro-Japanese factions in China that I read in the book. Next, let me talk about the information that I know by reading this book: Zhang Xunâ€™s restoration is supported by the Japanese; Yuan Shikai was stationed in North Korea, and the North Korean aristocrats resisted Japanâ€™s invasion of North Korea. The Japanese were more resistant to Yuan Shikaiâ€™s because they felt He is not obedient. Yuan Shikaiâ€™s plan for Japan is sometimes tempted, and sometimes alienated. Through this historical fact, Yuan Shikai should be the type of Cao Cao, with strong ambition and revenge. There is another point in this book that makes me a little bit unbearable. It is also a love to say and promote the Three People&#39;s Principles and publicize Mr. Sun Yat-sen&#39;s greatness. I don&#39;t like to watch such content. Compared with &quot;Chrysanthemum and Knife&quot;, because of wearing and studying in Japan, the understanding of the Japanese is more concrete, and the understanding of Japan&#39;s historical changes is clearer.

631,"Mainland movies are not graded for the time being. In the horror film, the correctness of socialism is still required, and there can be no real ghosts. From the current situation, this requirement is really necessary. And this kind of requirement has created a brand new point of view for China&#39;s horror film? No matter how the film begins to pretend to be a ghost, in the end, it must be self-explanatory. It is one of the most distinctive features of the Chinese horror film. This requirement has had a huge impact on Hong Kong&#39;s traditional horror films, but they have gradually adapted to this policy and have begun to produce a better type of film that meets the needs of the Mainland. In the past two years, the review department in charge of the film has clearly shown signs of relaxation in the examination of other film subjects other than political subjects. The theme of horror movies is the largest relative scale. Take the movie &quot;Yu Ying Ji Mi&quot; which has just been released as an example. The release of the film is of great significance. &quot;Socialist values&quot; cannot speak of &quot;supernatural phenomena.&quot; &quot;è¯¡å©´å‰å’ª&quot; is actually condensing the sinister temperament of the house on a rag doll called &quot;Jimmy&quot;. Although it said a mental illness event in which a pregnant woman was pregnant and aborted, in the end, the problem was concentrated on this raging doll. Body. Because the people in the house have died, the ragdoll that witnessed the process of the dead has brought evil, which directly leads to the death of the pregnant woman... This story can be successfully reviewed by the film review department, and it is available in the mainland. The meaning of the record. &quot;Yu Ying Jimi&quot; is undoubtedly talking about a supernatural phenomenon. In order to cope with the paradox of this supernatural phenomenon, the film even does not hesitate to fabricate a tattered old man directly opposite the high-end villa. The old man bluntly said that the house had evil spirits. The film undoubtedly hints at all fans, but all those who have died in the house have evil spirits. This is creepy. The problem of the evil spirits of the house in the film is only the problem of yin and yang in Chinese traditional culture. The folks also call it &quot;watch feng shui.&quot; At the moment, there are unscientific ingredients in it. But in ancient times, this technique was seen as a legacy of learning. The ancient Chinese are very interesting. On the surface, they want to talk about Confucius and Menciusâ€™s theory that â€œthere are still a few things that people have not figured out, and the ghosts are first rolled upâ€, while studying the yin and yang five elements in the back. The Yin and Yang family and the five elements are actually an important philosophical school during the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period in China. As the yin and yang and the five elements of cultural existence, it is necessary to understand. Of course, the Yin and Yang family and the five elements, and later with the development of Taoism, have to eat together. RoadThe family went to establish Taoism, and also forged a book called Laozihua Hu Jing, saying that your Buddha is in the cow&#39;s fork, and Sakyamuni is also the ancestor of our ancestors. During the Yin and Yang family and the five elements, during the Han Dynasty, some scholarships were incorporated into Dong Zhongshu&#39;s Tianren induction theory. The rest of the things can only be &quot;self-employed&quot; and &quot;the country does not care for the elderly&quot;. Looking at feng shui is the main work of this group of people, green and pollution-free. Most of the theories of Feng Shui have not exceeded the theory of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements in the Warring States Period. Looking at the homestead is an important part of Feng Shui. Although it is a new era, the technology of watching Feng Shui is still in existence. In many places, to build a house and dig a graveyard, you have to ask the &quot;knowful&quot; Mr. They also talk about the problem of yin and yang. In &quot;Yi Ying Ji Mi&quot;, the man can shake Jimmy, it is yang. This kind of qi theory is also abundant in Chinese traditional culture. In order to increase the dissent of the film, &quot;Infant Jimmy&quot; even created the story of &quot;suicide music.&quot; The so-called listening to music that makes people commit suicide is also the concept of &quot;qi&quot; in Chinese traditional culture. Chinese medicine is arrogant, and traditional Chinese literary criticism is also about qi, or qi. The reason why suicidal music is uncomfortable, can be explained by the theory of qi. Chinese traditional culture is extremely inclusive, and the simple materialistic concept is in harmony with the low-key idealism. Of course, for these things, we must divide the path and the avenue. The ancients also paid attention to the correctness of the values. You can&#39;t talk about yin and yang. When you say this thing, everyone must be overcast. You have to talk about the treatment. The Confucius and Mencius is interesting. You give a sentence directly?? In traditional Chinese literature and art, although it is also involved in ghosts and gods, it is often a writer&#39;s consciousness to defeat evil spirits. However, in contrast, &quot;è¯¡å©´å‰å’ª&quot; is actually a horror for terror, a lot of yin, and no arrogance against it, and finally to convey to people a &quot;dead man&#39;s house is still best to move away&quot; The theory is inconsistent with Chinese traditional culture. From my personal point of view, the film&#39;s value orientation is problematic and may mislead many fans. Therefore, I said that the film review department has become more and more serious in the review of the subject matter of horror films. Of course, I have always believed that the value orientation of a film should not be given to who should help management. Instead, it should establish the self-discipline of the writer and the writer himself. The ghosts and gods must not only be scary.It is!

What is the life expectancy of the comet? The more advanced the civilization, the less it feels about life? Even if the planet is about to be destroyed, in the case where a suitable planet is known, it is only responsible for the mistakes it has made, not for aggression. Resting on the United States, huh, huh... Itâ€™s obvious that such a heroic movie that looks like a high-end atmosphere is deeply influenced by Nolan. I have to admit that at the beginning, the skills of removing some memories were slightly vulgar, and the whole story was very creative. No one would have thought that Superman, who is a tall and full-image, has his grief, that is, loneliness, loneliness as a stranger, and loneliness as an unknown person. I don&#39;t know where I am from, I don&#39;t know what kind of life I have, I don&#39;t know what my purpose is. If there is no super power, perhaps he will exist as a peasant, perhaps as a journalist, with those secrets, perhaps lonely, perhaps to find some family feelings after marrying and having children. So at the beginning of the story, he kept changing places, kept wandering, looking for the answer he wanted. This is the first place in the film that I feel moved. But he is a superman, destined to be different, nonsense, or what we look at. So his enemy is coming. Very sad, the enemy he has to face is the one he is looking for. In the middle of the fight, I really want people to vomit. Is it that the fight between Superman is to hit each other at an ultra-speed, and it seems that they have not seen Jackie Chan movies. In other words, Superman is the old man who has transformed the amount of solar energy that can be absorbed. Why can every comet be done? Then what did his scientist, the old man, do to his middle part? Is this the secret that only Louis knows? Then, the second place I moved was the monologue of the general. No matter what I did, just to make my people live, just like the confession of the group in the shadow of the fire, the instant image went up. But he hit it again like a fool, and the image went on in an instant. Once again, I spoke Supermanâ€™s fight, saying that the last one was twisted and the neck was almost low, and I couldnâ€™t bear it.

633,"There were two motives for learning Japanese in the past, one was to want to mix into the network forest of Haruki Murakami, and the other was because of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s &quot;Hal&#39;s Moving Castle.&quot; When I saw Yu Chenxiongâ€™s &quot;The Wind&quot;, I was filled with the emerald green of &quot;Hal&#39;s Moving Castle&quot; and the &quot;Constraints of the World&quot; that always made me cry. &quot;You are not in my memory, but in a gentle wind.&quot; The story tells me that &quot;I&quot; spent the last days of her life in a lonely and quiet mountain sanatorium with a terminal illness. It is the most gorgeous life. This extremely simple story has become fascinating in the writings of Yu Chenxiong. He uses detailed and detailed writing to describe mountains, forests, villages, farmland, write cockscomb-shaped snow tops, write small flowers of various colors, and occlude them. The space is as pleasing as possible, and the picture is full of emotions. Only the text can see the picture in Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s animation. But the real moving of the story is still the mourning love that happened at the end of the festival. This love can be said to be &quot;the constraint of the world.&quot; On the one hand, the countdown to the life of the festival will inevitably lead to the countdown of the end of this love; on the other hand, &quot;two people hold the fear and anxiety that cannot be shared with each other&quot;, so that both people are cautiously holding &quot;taboos&quot; Communicating with the other side, avoiding the proposition of death, but talking about the irrelevant topic between the four seasons of reincarnation and the alternating day and night. It is Lin Xiâ€™s â€œWait until the scenery is seen, maybe you will accompany me to see the long streamâ€. Although the sanatorium&#39;s away from the dust provided the two with the convenience of escaping the topic of &quot;death,&quot; the shadow never walked away from them. Marquez said that love and death are very close. I think maybe because the death is near before I will think about the meaning of love, love is growing in fear of loss. The reason why Juke is willing to come to a remote sanatorium is because &quot;I&quot; gave her reasons to live. Yan Chenxiong is not intended to tell a mourning love story, but to talk about the meaning of life through a love story. In his view, the meaning of life is no longer alive, no longer the beating of the heart and the stability of the respiratory function, but the radiance. This was discovered in the first winter after the death of the festival. &quot;I&quot; walked away from the villagers&#39; home and walked toward his cabin. &quot;I thought that the light of my life was only a few things around me. In fact, Just like the light of this cabin, it is much more than I imagined. These lights don&#39;t seem to follow my consciousness, they will live my life like a light.Life continues...&quot; Just as &quot;I&quot; inspired the power of the festival to fight for life and the hope of living, the festival also gave the &quot;I&quot; the light of life. The meaning of life is not alone. It is to let others have a desire to live. This also corresponds to the opening poem &quot;There is a blast, life does not give up.&quot; I quite like this story and Yu Chenxiong&#39;s interpretation of the meaning of life, but also forget &quot;I &quot;The festival stands on the hill and listens to the scene of the wind, but I don&#39;t like the way Chen Chenxiong writes. Excessive scenery, complicated and boring, make this book that is not thick is very thick.&quot; Yu Chenxiongâ€™s portrayal of psychology is too straightforward and lacks skill. The â€œIâ€ and the festivalâ€™s two peopleâ€™s jealousy and the words are not dare to say that they are being stunned by Chen Chenxiongâ€™s writings, and they suddenly lose their reading. Interesting. It is the present of a person, and the sunshine from yesterday when the two people are together is pouring from the shadow of the tree. After that parting afternoon, it is also a personâ€™s present, but tomorrow is no end in the flower. Scent, no matter what When are you there?",movie
634,"In the strict sense, Stalingrad is not a war film. Apart from the opening beach battles and intermittent bombers, there are not many war scenes, and more are the close battles in the ravines and buildings. The film does not torture the humanity like the previous World War II film or to expose the cruelty of war in a broader perspective. Instead, it uses two loves to highlight the theme of justice and fearless sacrifice, true love and fear of death. The trailer can make a wrong marketing guide. When you walk into the theater and think about it, you find that it is just a love song. This stick is one of the reasons why most people give bad reviews. In fact, the biggest problem of the film is not to use war to package the gap brought by love, but to use the war as a background but there is no normal war consciousness. The Russian soldiers in the film not only shot and killed their own people, but they went out to fight with the enemy. They simply did it, and there was no strategy at all. There was no literacy and behavior that a soldier should have. Moreover, the film did not tell the audience why they insisted on the building, including the intention of the battle. The Germans had more people to take the next building. It was not so happy as an old woman. In the plot, the Russian army clearly has a liaison but it is basically a display. In addition to the final self-sacrifice, it comes to call the cannon, but why not blow it up early and not blow it up, the German base is clearly opposite them! Therefore, the film is almost empty for World War II, which has all the normal logic of the war. It is only for us to pay attention to the &quot;five dads.&quot; And the movie has an incredible setting at the opening, the Russians tell others about the earthquake in Japan. Why are there five dads! ! ! The narrative is to ambush the pen, but the suspense that this film gave us is why there are five fathers? It was really from the beginning that there was a full dissonance film about the five Russian soldiers who broke through the encirclement and succeeded in occupying a run-down building in the German region, and they accidentally married a Russian girl in the building. In this short period of time, the five male soldiers in the film and the girl have a strong relationship, including love, friendship, and family ties beyond the blood relationship, the film uses many small details of the micro Rendering a small touch of mutual support between people during the war. Although the background of the film is scheduled for World War II, the director is very objective to tell this historical story. He does not hate the German army as an enemy. Instead, he uses a lot of ink to describe the love of the German officer Kahn. He resolutely crossed. The boundaries of the country fall in love with an exotic woman, he does for loveEverything needs great courage. This is a relatively humanized description of the Nazi Germans in the history of the film. The proportion of love in the film is far greater than the war. It can be said that the director gave up the war from the perspective of the soldier, but instead interpreted the cruelty of war from the perspective of men and women. Although the two heroines have no identity in the movie, they are all separated from the battlefield. Even in the guns and shells, they can still live their own lives, and they have the cleanliness of mud. Male soldiers are an indispensable element of this battlefield. Unfortunately, they are in this whirlpool but can&#39;t struggle. The film uses narration to tell us about the tragic family life of male soldiers. It is in stark contrast to the uniqueness of women. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the length of the film, the film did not show the character of several soldiers more deeply, only a little bit to the end, but fortunately at least can also give the audience room and room for recall. The scenery and color of the film are very depressed cold colors, the gray sky makes people not see the hope of survival, and the only warm color is the flame. Only the flames in the film not only burned the living Russian soldiers and Jewish women, but also destroyed the building that brought warmth. In fact, this house in the film has a great symbolic meaning in the movie. It is not only the base for the soldiers of the two countries to confront each other, but also the home of their wreckage. Even if they are attacked by gunfire all the time, they may be silent. The interest is to bury life in the night, but as long as staying in that building, there will be a warm home. When the building collapsed and was destroyed by the ruthless artillery bombardment, the bodies of several soldiers buried in the ruins of the house were considered a warmth of despair. It can be said that there is no previous heroic complex in Stalingrad, nor does it raise the theme to the national honor and disgrace. The reason for the soldiers fighting for life is a woman and a broken building, and the emotions are also in the film. An important component of the adjustment war. After diluting the cold and hard, the film brought us a rare warmth in the war world, and in the warm love, I believe that the war is no longer so embarrassing and terrible! To be honest, if it is not the background of World War II, I really have no mood to pull out so much!",movie

In the end, the female confession confessed that the lover and A Liangâ€™s seniors opened the female main album. But the value of the film cannot be denied because it is far more beautiful than reality. The positive values â€‹â€‹it expresses are worth learning. First of all, the practice of being discriminated against is not unwilling to see people, but it is not good. If it is a secret struggle, it is good, but the mentality and the original intention should not be forgotten. When Xiao Shui faces a beautiful girl in front of his favorite boys, Not hiding inferiorly, but bravely standing up and letting him see himself. Although he has already noticed her and then the trade-off between friendship and love, it is wrong for the brothers not to say their love, so you are entangled. Itâ€™s the feelings of three people, not the selflessness. Finally, Iâ€™m afraid that not many people can do it in 9 years, but the punctures in the movie and the lyrical music are very moving, just because there is less in reality. Yes, it will be the ideal, it will be beautiful, it will be extravagant, will it be moved to PS: see the pure and beautiful emotions in the film, let me think that I have had such expectations and cry, and finally wake up, The hero is too perfect, so everything for the woman is worth it, but what if it is not worthy of your love?

When it is misunderstood, it is not anxious to justify. This is both an advantage and a defect. In the end, it is also the ultimate in classmates, the teacher&#39;s comprehensive suppression and the pressure of life, the result of the comprehensive effect of the parents&#39; coercion, and the individual thinks that such students are in existence in real life. But in the end it was only in obscurity, mediocrity ended in life, and the author gave such a sad ending, containing deep irony and insinuating the meaning of the real society. Schools for students, especially teenagers, are in adolescence, fascinated, rebellious, should guide rather than suppress, how can the future be defined as bad students because of mischievous or not learning?

It will become a movie of &quot;Give Sugar or Trick or Treat?&quot; The audience wants sugar, naturally everything, kung fu, adventure, beauty, handsome, mysterious, funny, what kind of taste is there; if the audience wants to swear, the film is also calm, because the story content is too much metaphor and metaphor, the director borrows The production of sincerity and the absurd narrative structure hides many critical topics that are &quot;trick&quot; to this real society, and is destined to become a metaphor for this year. &quot;Iron Blood Cara&quot; is a rough look, but it is a thrilling jungle adventure film, a group of nosebleed popping angels, several kung fu powerful masters from all over the world, the original tiger tribe in the depths of the jungle A battle full of humanity and animalism, the film&#39;s perception and the &quot;Girls&#39; Special Forces&quot; have some ideas. The excitement is lively, but after careful examination, behind this endless glitz surface, it is actually the most ruthless criticism of many problems in the real society. Only by hiding the theme deeply in this type of male woman can the film be Smoothly released, but anyone who can&#39;t avoid the real topic can give you deep thoughts after watching the movie. The tiger tribes, typical aborigines, have lived in the jungle for generations, but they have never been disturbed by the world, but the few people who have come to the scene have broken the balance of thousands of years and the armed forces headed by an international group. Under the command of the local local tyrants, the rambling implants, blown up the tribes, strong and strong men and women, occupying the land and mining. The jungle version of Avatar was restored. This is a hegemonic hegemony that is projected from the mainland to the Meike and spread from the alien to the jungles of Southeast Asia. In this country that was forced to mourn by the demolitions, filmed and released such a The film really needs the courage to be supreme. The story is dictated by the director ASAM and tells a journey that is hard to forget. As soon as the picture turns, we can see that ASAM is in a large audience and competes with others for the ability to eat eggs. The figure is dry, but it is easy to win. Later, I learned that the so-called tour guide, which was in the middle of the city, was actually the heir to the tiger tribe chieftain in the jungle, but could not resist the temptation of the so-called &quot;civilized&quot; life. He left the hot land where he raised him and became a city struggle. a family. This is similar to how many of our migrant workers are now entering the city. They have abandoned the farmland, abandoned their family ties, made the fields ridiculous, and left the left-behind and left-behind children.The accident continued, and after they entered the city and entered the factory, they were still slaves to the working machine, and there was no sense of turning over. Who is going to change the social status of eating fruit? In the final analysis, life is &quot;work&quot;. Migrant workers do not guard the beautiful pastoral gardens, but they have to enter the city. But the big girls in the city have excellent office and living environment. They have to go everywhere to explore, and there is no such thing. See through the &quot;impulse&quot; of life. In recent years, it is common for some travellers to be trapped in the mountains and to dispatch the armed police to go to the rescue story. People canâ€™t help but want to marry their mothers. One person is not enough to die, and they have to suffer a bunch of people. I really donâ€™t understand. The same is true of the five-year-old dolls in the film. The ones who are unprofessional and unconventional, even dare to enter the dense jungle, are also the courage of the ignorant fearless, but unfortunately, their fighting ability is not too strong, a poison in the mountains, The dart is about to lose the life of the ugliest younger sister, and the other few are not shackled, and are locked in a small cage that is hoisted. I just want to say, I beg you, donâ€™t go on the so-called hiking and expeditions. Itâ€™s a disaster for the society. The rich people who have emerged in China in recent years are stunned. They either develop real estate or mine, they donâ€™t see the mainland. The big money of the coal mine iron ore oil mine has already shown off the image of the rich man of the earthen bun to the whole world? But this is only a microcosm. It is said that in many abandoned mining areas after mining, the ecology has been completely destroyed, and the surrounding residents&#39; environment is also miserable. Whether it is underground cavities, landslides, or ecological pollution, it causes cancer. A series of deteriorating reactions, such as villages, are man-made. The same is true in the film &quot;Iron Blood&quot;, the mining industry is rich in funds, the local local tyrants, the international team, and the support of the armed forces, cultural celebrities (host An Zhijie) take the lead, it is organized and premeditated, it is a place The administrative collusion is dominated by bullies. &quot;Iron Blood Angel&quot; should be a Tucao film, through the actors and plots, carry out a variety of spit, whether it is the above four maps, or the various slots presented in the film, there is a brain. For many years of film lovers, the battle platform is still very impressive about the appearance of Mulong in the film, young, handsome, martial arts high-powered, but you are Japanese, in our film and television drama, can only say NO to you! ! ! The last tragic death is also the intention of all the people, who let us have revenge. Having said that, the director is obviously recovering the image of the big breasted woman. Who said that the chest is big and brainless, and that Pan Shuangshuang Bobowa are actually beautiful and intelligent, but they sprayed on women.The oils have long faces and long ambitions. The men were treated differently. Zou Zhaolong and Shi Yanneng, respectively, played a role of a harmonious role, and they were the best men, but the handsome guy who was obviously a high-end intellectual hosted An Zhijie, which turned out to be the blackest one. Hey, itâ€™s also a practice joke that everyone often said: â€œA handsome guy can rely on it, a sow will go to the treeâ€. Of course, the biggest highlights of the film are Zou Zhaolong, Shi Yanneng, An Zhijie, Mu Xiaolong, and other actionable superstars, as well as Yu Man, Pan Shuangshuang, Wang Danyi Li, Tan Lina, and other women who have a lot of effort and effort. The Hanzi group, even if it is not placed in the jungle outside the country, is simply throwing the two teams into a playground, it will be an eye-opening event.",movie
638,"&quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is a jailbreaking high IQ crime film starring the two tough guys, Shi Daye and Shi Daye. Who said that the limbs are developed with simple minds. In the deep prison of &quot;Golden Shelling&quot;, only good skills + good wisdom In order to survive, escape the day of birth. Of course, most of the murderers are murderous and savage, and they are strong, sturdy, and brutal, but in the face of professional jailbreaker Stallone, they are completely dwarfed. How to let the audience follow the jailbreaking veteran in the fleeting details, feel the thrill of breaking through the cage, rely on the tension of the plot to set up support, therefore, the wonderful and breakthrough imagination, become the biggest look of the film point. The jailbreak is a film and television drama. There are a wide mass base in the Mainland. Because of the various revolutionary films such as &quot;Red Rock&quot;, &quot;Honghu Red Guard&quot;, &quot;Eternal Life in the Fire&quot;, &quot;Jiang Jie&quot; and so on, the revolutionaries are unfortunate. When he was jailed, he was rarely successful in jailbreaking. He felt grievances in his heart. When he suddenly saw the jailbreaking film and television drama, he was relieved a lot. Therefore, Hong Kong films such as &quot;Prison Storm&quot; series, such as &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;Air Prison&quot;, &quot;The Desperate Island&quot;, etc., have given the audience too much venting power, and they are all chased by hot reviews. In recent years, the popular American drama &quot;Prison Break&quot; has added a lot of fire. I don&#39;t know how many fans are crazy. After reading it, I plan to go to the prison to try my hand. Unfortunately, I lack a chance. Fortunately, you can go to see the current &quot;Golden Shelling&quot;, at least go to the theater, feel the desperation of entering the prison door deep like the sea, and then you can experience the boundless joy of regaining freedom. Of course, there is still a big difference between &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; and &quot;Prison Break&quot;. One is jailbreaking as a profession, and one is going to jailbreak to save people. The prison settings in the two works are not in the same order of magnitude. TV dramas naturally have their own Cost considerations, the prison now seems to be a &quot;little little&quot;, but as a big investment and big production of commercial films, &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is worthy of the two Hollywood actresses in the prison setting. The super-prison &quot;grave&quot; in the story is the most dangerous, cold, mysterious and stunned behemoth. When Stallone first escaped from the cage, he discovered the so-called &quot;grave&quot;. It is a huge ship floating on the sea, surrounded by water, can not see the land and ships, the moment of victory is killed in an instant, and the natural environment and personal will double defeat to the helpless history of the uncle, I have to be in a hurryIn the middle of the re-entry, and the friends? Mysterious beard Uncle Schwarzenegger, and then negotiate a new way out. From the plot, &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is a perfect confined space movie. The plot is carried out in a small prison. The place where it can be moved is very small, but the small deep sea prison has a hole in the sky, which is as complex as human beings. society. From the perspective of deconstruction, &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is a typical Chinese-style &quot;spear and shield&quot; story. On the one hand, Stallone, a jailbreak expert, constantly challenges the most stringent prisons, trying to find loopholes to make the prison stronger. The record of 14 prisons in the past 8 years is indeed an incredible experience. This time, he fell into a private prison full of conspiracy, which was built with reference to his books on the construction of safe prisons. Sturdy to almost seamless, with their own intelligence, challenge their wisdom, there are all kinds of conspiracy and conspiracy in prison, all kinds of wits, all kinds of sophisticated design, all kinds of coincidences, it is difficult to think of color. Of course, it is still necessary to add that the big country is jailbroken, and it is only a show on the big screen. You should not think that the prisons in the Mainland are not more scientific than the country. If you fall into the legal gateway and go to jail, you will also try to The more you think about it, the more you donâ€™t want it, because the prisoner has to be killed at any time as long as he gets out of the prison safety line. The most important thing is that there is no trust in the prison, such as the female doctor in Prison Break or the Golden Shell. The &quot;deformed&quot; of a male doctor can help you escape.",movie
639,"This film is 05 of the Korean history box office list. The film was actually finished two days ago, because it took two days to write. The film tells the story of a South Korean pair of friends who entered the palace and entered a palace with a faint monarch. A pair of plays, both of them are men, one looks beautiful, one grows rough, they play together every day, so the feelings are deep. One day, the American man was taken over by the rich, and the rough man was very unhappy and fled with a beautiful man. The rich then pursued the killing, but in the pursuit of the killing, the American man hacked the rich man, and the two had to flee to Beijing. After coming to the capital, the two quickly gained a foothold and conquered a few plays, so that everyone formed a troupe to make money. In order to make more money, the rough man led everyone to show off the obscenity of the king. Soon, the troupe was discovered by the officials in the palace, and the players were arrested to be killed. The rough man is not convinced, and the resistance said that the king would laugh when he saw the show, so the official asked them to perform in the palace. So, the actors came to the palace to perform, which attracted the king and the pets were very happy. After several performances in succession, the performances of the actors reminded the king of his mother and aroused his anger against the ministers and the monks. This caused the king to kill the murder of the mother and some ministers. The ministers decided to use hunting to kill the actors, but ultimately failed. After that, the king was with the American men every day, and he fell out of favor. Rough men want to go a few times, the American men have no consent. At this point, the pet is designed to frame the American man because of the loss of favor, but this is all smashed by the rough man. This made the rough man caught, and then he was fined for blinking because of the performance of the satirical king. The kingâ€™s punishment for the rough man allowed the American man to commit suicide but was rescued. In the end, the rough man who became blind continued to act for the American male, and the army that overthrew the king also acted. I heard about this movie just after it was hot. It is said to be very hot. I expect this to be a very good movie. However, when I finished watching the movie, I knew that I guessed it wrong? The movie is not good at all, even dull. why? Because the movie only tells the story of a pair of friends against the king, how is this different from other love or basic movies? Isn&#39;t it an emotion like collapse, pain, heartbreak, etc? These bridges have been shown thousands of times in many movies! The only difference in this film is that it has added some historical background, but these history are not unusual. How can North Korea&#39;s faint monk compare with China&#39;s faint? Therefore, this film is not a good movie. Video advantages onlyThere is one place that reflects some of the history of North Korea, but this is what modern movies should have? Does it reflect some historical facts and movies? Even so, I am not interested in the history of North Korea. There is no need to understand a small history of a small country. Even if the economy of South Korea is developed now, this country will eventually be overwhelmed by other countries. Now watching their movies is just for pleasure. So in general, the shortcomings of the film are mainly mediocrity: it spends most of its time repeating stories that others have said. Can a movie that doesn&#39;t have any freshness feel like it can be invested? But perhaps this film is very good for others, after all, people enjoy different levels of appreciation. The film production is worse than the &quot;double-sided king&quot;, and the shooting aspect is common. The setting of &quot;Double King&quot; is gorgeous and colorful, and the atmosphere is bright. The film is a bit simplistic, and the scene is small and lacks big scenes. But the costumes of the actors can still be seen, I guess the producers spend all their money here. Other aspects of the film are common, not to mention. Finally, mentioning the sensuality in the film is too straightforward. Is North Korea so open in ancient times? I don&#39;t think so! Probably the Koreans of the color are obscenity. South Korea is a strange country! The actors are quite satisfactory. The two male protagonists didn&#39;t feel anything. Li Junji didn&#39;t see how beautiful it was. He was just a normal-looking man with a pretty face. The only actress is Jiang Chengwei, who looks the same. Her appearance is much worse than the plastic beauty in other Korean movies. Is the director&#39;s choice of the corner problem? When I watched a Korean movie, I had an expectation for the actress, even if it was not beautiful, it would be beautiful! The rest of the film is a dragon, and the same is true of the king&#39;s actor Zheng Zhenrong. in conclusion. This is an ordinary basic movie, boring, boring, clichÃ©, and very boring.

People with troops say that modern snipers are not as mysterious as people think, but this does not affect people&#39;s association with this magical profession. In terms of name, this movie is called sniper, which should be considered the most ideal name. But the movie is not worthy. It seems that the sniper has a psychological need to pass, that is the guilty feeling of murder. Due to the close proximity and focus of the scope, they seem to have a hard time excluding this guilt. I have never experienced it before, and I have never met anyone who has such an experience. Anyway, it is difficult for me to understand, I feel incredible, and even think that this is a very unprofessional idea. I believe that there is such a sniper, there is no need to turn over that hurdle. Which of these two snipers has more potential? I don&#39;t know, the latter may have more potential, but the former may be reborn after turning over that hurdle, and the energy that can be produced by such a baptized person is hard to estimate.

641,"I have never actually seen &quot;ride to Berlin&quot; on TV completely, but for some time, whether it is Douban or other websites, I often see someone saying something like this: Some things, you don&#39;t do it now, all your life Will not do it. As long as you want to do something, the world will come to help you. This sentence comes from this sensational documentary, &quot;Climb to Berlin&quot;. One of my brothers, doing journalism work, basically not traveling, after seeing this film, it was actually ignited. Together with the civil servant wife, I found a broken cardboard and wrote the name of a local town in Yunnan. I set off on a weekend morning and started a hot ride. It is a pity that they started from the middle of &quot;Hit to Berlin&quot;. At that time, the two protagonists had already arrived in Eastern Europe, and the ride was a very simple car. In the end, this buddy took his wife for a long time without any result. He had to spend 15 yuan on the bus, and the ride has not yet begun, it is over. When I was not busy last year, I received several foreign sofas, one of whom was a British traveler. The young man named Daniel is a Cambridge student. Vacationing by car is a mainstream vacation and a valuable experience for reaching out to different cultures. In the process, if you are a person who asks for help, you will often have a deeper impression and feeling for those who give you help. My wife and I used to live in an uncle&#39;s sofa in Australia. The feeling is completely different from staying at a hotel. Itâ€™s romantic to ride a car and sleep on the sofa, but itâ€™s far from the life of most of us. Our lives are often modeled and have ready-made standards and patterns, and it&#39;s hard to find a sense of curiosity in them. In other words, the Chinese really don&#39;t understand life. I think this is also the reason why the documentary &quot;Hello to Berlin&quot; has caused such great concern in China: so many young people have looked up from the daily numb life and saw a completely different world. Everyone was surprised. I found out that there are two ordinary people who are similar to themselves, spending a little time and a small amount of money, plus a little courage, but have experienced such a romantic life. The book version of &quot;Climb to Berlin&quot; is slightly different. The things that have undergone a complete process and precipitated are also more personal feelings of the author Liu Chang. Some netizens commented that this book is more of a whisper that he wrote to himself. At first glance, the line between the words seems to be a running account record for the rider, occasionally detailed, occasionally brief, occasionallyJapanese sorrowful mother, occasionally thankful. If we look forward to finding universal philosophies in this book, we may be disappointed. But in fact, these dull, boring and even hard, is the normal state of travel. Liu Chang did not go to Berlin to beautify anything, but did not sublimate anything, just like he said: &quot;I am not more than the will of ordinary people, nor a professional traveler. I just want to pursue something that I think is important. Friends set foot on the journey. At the end of the journey, everyoneâ€™s heart was partially fulfilled because of this road. So the original goal is no longer important.â€ But this ordinary attitude should be Travel itself. Travel is really a personal matter, it is the perfection of one&#39;s own personality, or like the title of the book, is the &quot;30-year-old adult ceremony&quot;, rather than the feat of two people, marketing or a piece of forced label. If it is the latter, it is just a sneak peek at the current life. Although my family and I have had some travel experiences, they are all about it. When I read this book, I was full of yearning for the Eastern European exoticism written in the book, and it reminded me of the moving moments and people in my journey. Looking forward to my next trip, I also secretly plan, can I also have a book-like, baptismal travel experience?

642,"After finishing the film in one sentence, a Hong Kong person brought a group of Hong Kong people to the mainland to kill from Tianjin to Tianjin, killing the same and ending. This is a film of the Ministry and its realism. It shows despair. It reflects that human beings can even say that animals are most instinctive. In order to survive, morality can have no bottom line. In the face of survival, family, friendship, loyalty, dignity, and even conscience are not worth mentioning. This is the most realistic portrayal of people in the face of death. Cai Tianming can say that everything is put down for living. I don&#39;t know if other people have this feeling. There is no war in the other films in this film. There are various infernal ways, various psychological wars, and some of them are the most primitive reactions, but they are also the most real. In fact, I began to be confused for a long time. Why did he have so many opportunities to escape before he did not escape? I always thought that all this was designed by him. I was always looking forward to the final reversal, but in the end he was in a sudden At the moment, I used the most direct method, confronting each other and then trying to escape. Later, I suddenly understood, in fact, he has not planned anything, but he did all this with his most primitive survival instinct. When a person can be jealous of himself, the other people are nothing. In the end, in order to escape, he used his car door to lick his hand again and again until he opened it. And I believe that if there is a knife or the like at the end, he will see the foot he is holding. This is a kind of survival desire that is infinitely magnified, almost morbid. Everyone has different values, and some people put things on top of survival, such as honor, affection, credit, and so on. But when a person is simply driven by the desire to be born, it is actually terrible, and the movie just magnifies this. From the beginning to the end, he did not have any self-blame, no struggle, no plan, just to survive. At this time, people return to a primitive state. When the bottom of the pyramid is threatened, the above are not important. Man becomes a state of a beast, without thinking, and only the original impulse. Therefore, it became a state of killing God by God and killing Buddha by Buddha. But he has no other kind of courage in the movie. He can beg for mercy and betray his brother. He can help the police, and he can be twice as many times as he can; he can sell for a second. The seven-man gang, but in the next second told the seven-man gang is actually surrounded by police. He does not have any principles, just thinksTo live. This is very rare in other movies I watch, especially in this era of personal heroism, this &#39;traitorous&#39; character is generally a small supporting role. So I think this is a breakthrough in this movie. In summary, there are only three stars, because he is only violent, and there is no aesthetics, which makes the visual effect inferior. Another star is for the final ending. In fact, at the beginning, I felt that Johnnie Toâ€™s film with mainland actors always felt strange, especially when I was photographed, I had the feeling that this film was going to be ruined, especially like the education that the school organized. The feeling of the piece. But I can&#39;t bear it. (I admit that if I don&#39;t have Zhong Hanliang and Gu Tianle, I can&#39;t stand it.) When I finally endured the ending, I found out that the reason why Hong Kong film was called Hong Kong film is still reasonable. In the end, there was no way for the police and the seven-man gang to be evenly beaten and injured to four policemen who were beaten by two deaf-mute people. Finally, they were all solved directly by Gu Tianle. Don&#39;t say less, this is the unprecedented loss of the Chinese police that I have seen before. If it is a mainland film, it is estimated that the length of the film is generally enough. The background is explained in the front, and the next one is broken. Finally, a commendation meeting can be done. But there was no poison war. After the defeat in Ezhou, I thought that I was sure that it was also a big ending, and it ended up dead. However, I personally feel that the ending is stopped here, and the last one is slightly redundant. Finally, I think that I feel a bit of a fly in the ointment, that is, I started to spread the stalls a bit big, and finally I feel a little bit of an anticlimax, but maybe as I said before, maybe the director is to highlight the most primitive life-seeking desire, so it is not very elaborate. design. Then there is another point, my little sun is so bad, um, it is very good to ignore this other, I personally prefer this kind of realism.",movie

The appearance of silk overflows the true nature of 2B, and the exaggerated body humor and French exotic small romance are just right. The fusion has made this absurd and cheerful romantic love comedy. The comedy elements of the film are also diverse and exquisite.

647,"Li Xiangxing, the leader of the gang and Liansheng, was killed on the spot by a broken glass that suddenly fell from the sky. The police arrived and made the case an accident. In fact, accidents are the illusion created by criminal gangs. The head of the gang, He Guohui (Gu Tianle), and the women (Ye Ye ornaments), Fei Yu (Lin Xue ornaments) and Aber (Feng Quailing) four people, according to the client&#39;s request, often join hands to engage in accidental murder to get rich rewards. Li Xiangxing&#39;s murder process: the woman&#39;s car broke the road at the intersection, and the owner Li Xiangxing had to turn right into the trail. At this time, the Aber driving truck came on the scene, the two cars met each other and the water splashed by the truck made Li Xiangxing covered his face with his hands. At this time, Fei Yan untied the banner of the Youth Library to make him hit the windshield that Li Xiangxing was driving. When Li Xiangxing got off the car and pulled off the banner, he touched the organ, and the big glass hit him. The woman still stuck the car in place to obstruct the traffic, delaying the arrival time of the ambulance, so that the victim could not be killed on the spot. When Aber left the car, he discarded the cigarette butt and returned to the meeting place to be told by the woman about the saliva on the cigarette. Aber wants to go back and pick up, the woman said that he has helped him pick up. Fertilizer got the reward and returned to the gathering place. The brain appeared to reprimand Arbor, the cigarette butt was picked up in time, and the woman said that she was lying only worried that Abel would go back and have an accident. Aber said he would quit smoking. When the brain returned home, the home was very worn, and he put the reward into the safe, which already had a lot of money. The wife of the brain (Mo Xiaoqi) died before the accident in a car accident, but the brain did not believe it and thought it was artificial. The four men took over the task entrusted by Mr. Huang to let his father die unexpectedly. Huangâ€™s father was accompanied by a wheelchair all the time and needed Mr. Huangâ€™s care. The four people designed the accident: On a rainy night, the woman flew a kite on the roof and dropped it onto the wire and the kite line hanged. After Abel put the balloon over the camera, the fat man riding the bicycle hit the wheelchair Mr. Huang. The wheelchair was out of control, and the yellow father of the wheelchair was hit by a charged kite line and was electrocuted. In the implementation, Arbor forgot his promise and smoked the cigarette. He also forgot to put a balloon to cover the camera. After Huangâ€™s death, a bus suddenly lost control and ran into the brain. The brain escaped, but the fat canâ€™t escape from the bus. dead. When the brain came home and found that the house was stolen, all the money in the safe was lost. The police said that there was a theft upstairs and downstairs. It was a serial crime. The news reported that the bus was out of control and caused two deaths and eight injuries, but the brain thought that the death of fat was not an accident. He suspected that the woman, Aber, and Mr. Huang discovered thatHuang has an insurance salesman Chen Fangzhou (Ren Xianqi). The brain rented a house downstairs from Chen Fangzhou to the landlord to monitor Chen. The brain found that Aber still went to the scene where he made the accident of Huangâ€™s father to sell balloons every day. It turned out that Aber had partially lost his memory and was maintained by eating pills. The brain found that the woman collected money from Mr. Huang, because she was always responsible for taking orders and collecting money. He suspected that women tracked fat and sold themselves, while Chen Fangzhou was the mastermind, but women did not recognize it. The brain used a steel water valve sprayed from the hydrant&#39;s water pressure to kill the woman and create an accident. Mr. Huang committed suicide by jumping off the building. The brain found that its eavesdropper was found upstairs, the landlord accused the brain of doodles on the wall, and the brain saw Chen Fangzhou talking to the landlord. Aber fell from the second floor and was hospitalized. The brain thought of the previous eavesdropping record. Chen Fangzhou once said that the window was loose and fell from the second floor. The brain designed an accident, and the light reflected through the light made the driver unable to see the front and caused the vehicle to run out of control and killed Chen Fangzhou. When the brain was about to be implemented, the brain received an Arb phone call. Aber remembered that his own ball hit the bus and the bus was out of control. It was a fatal accident. It was an accident. The brain heard Chen Fangzhou&#39;s wife (Han Yuxi) yelling the landlord&#39;s father, recalling the previous deaths that finally understood the fatness of the death is an accident, Chen Fangzhou is innocent. The brain ran to cover the mirror with the body, but the car was still out of control and killed Chen Fangzhou&#39;s wife because of the light. Chen Fangzhou saw the unusual behavior of Gu Tianle. He knew that this was not an accident. It was the murder committed by Gu Tianle. Because the general rescuer would definitely run directly to his wife, he would not go back to the light. The brain cleaned up the room and left, and at the stairway, Chen Fangzhou licked the knife. If Chen Fangzhou made an accident to kill him, he would never use this method. The thoroughly understood brain fell and smiled. He got rid of it. &quot;We are making accidents, all accidents can be made.&quot; &quot;All is what you think of yourself.&quot; &quot;You lie, you even believe that you are.&quot; &quot;The only thing I lie to myself is that you will believe me.&quot; &quot;My wife died unexpectedly, and I made money by making fake accidents, so I thought that all the real accidents were artificially made.&quot; Fatty death is a real accident, the brain is stolen is a real accident, Aber fell on the window sill is a real accident, the brain installed the bug is found to be a real accident (Chen Fangzhou home decoration, renovation workers found). Mr. Huang jumped from the building and committed suicide. It is estimated that when he saw his fatherâ€™s death, he was very remorseful. Therefore, Chen Fangzhou did not give his fatherâ€™s death certificate to him several times. yellowAfter putting the money into the woman&#39;s car, the gentleman turned his door on the door with resentment. Later, Chen Fangzhou also said that Mr. Huang kept crying before jumping off the building and kept saying sorry. You think there is, there is nothing, and everything is your own devil. The cause and fate of the person who made the accidental murder was directly killed locally.",movie

649,"&quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is the most reliable Hollywood movie I have seen recently, not just animation, including live-action movies; it is also the most accurate and best-performing commercial entertainment movie I have seen recently, not just the introduction. Movies, including all domestic movies. Hollywood is Hollywood after all. Although it has recently exported so many famous and bad movies to the land of China, such as &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Steve Jobs&quot;, as long as people really want to, they can still make a round like &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;. Tact, sleek licensed movies, and is a boutique in the mainstream, licensed textbooks, licensed fighters. To say that it is licensed, not a great and groundbreaking cartoon, is actually very simple: it is not as deep and deep as &quot;Mary and Marx&quot;, not as grand and delicate as &quot;Crazy Primitives&quot;, not as great as &quot;The Great Fox Dad&quot; &quot;Because it is so unbiased before madness and normality, it is a Hollywood standard product full of streamlined style, and it is a standard work? There are simple but effective stories, flat but rich characters, and unexpected There is no surprise narrative, a theme that is far from reality but close to life. Letâ€™s tell the story first. The daughter of the old-fashioned big family fell in love with the man who shouldnâ€™t love. This ancient story with prototypes, we have seen its variants in many works of art (itâ€™s too lazy to unfold), which is exactly It proves that this is a kind of drama that is quite effective beyond the times. But the novel&#39;s novelty or victory lies in the use of type mashups to turn the obstruction of the elders into a comedy and a magical element? The vampire&#39;s daughter fell in love with the human boy, a little bit interesting, but nothing, so again Joining the elders&#39; obstruction, using funny magical means, well, if you don&#39;t care, then add a closed environment and time. The triple element is superimposed, how about it, enough taste. This is called Gao Ming&#39;s mashup. Besides, the characters are very simple. They are basically flat but have clear desires. To put it bluntly, the labels are clearly defined, and they know what they want, what they don&#39;t want, don&#39;t worry, and don&#39;t ride the wall. The most indispensable figure in a literary or artistic film is the most basic standard of this kind of film. What better than an old-fashioned but loving father, a beautiful but rebellious daughter, a handsome and upright boy, is more suitable for the group &quot;starring&quot; a popcorn love family ethics film? Say the narrative, the filmâ€™s ending fool guessesGet, must be affectionate... The man and the bat are finally married, and the father must agree that the daughter and the boy are in love. But the problem is that it is implemented in a concrete way, and there are too many tricks. For the creators, it depends on whether the tricks you play can make people feel unexpected surprises. Most domestically produced movies are basically not aware of the storyline. They are basically reduced points, but they are even more disappointing. The Hollywood film competition is the process of realization and novel details? Everyone has seen chasing planes. But who has seen the old man chasing a woman? And still fly to the sky and pull the smoke to chase? Everyone has seen the old man and the daughter-in-law, but who has seen the old man and the son-in-law in the obstacle race in the sky? Haven&#39;t seen it, let alone the phone, the screaming cake, the courier, the mosquito-sized elf couple, the husband and the slut, and the sneak peek at the details of his wife&#39;s bathing, even if you know all kinds of spoilers, Seeing it is full of interest. Finally, the theme is that there are many themes of the film. Although the plot is absurd, the imagination is unrestrained, but the theme is close to life and unpretentious. What generation gap, what kind of middle-aged crisis, what believes in the next generation, what not to kill the vitality of young people in the name of love, etc., are all familiar with the theme of people, without any reason to make a mystery, pretending to be profound, basic Chatting with the aunt on the street and the elementary school essay is about the same height, but this is exactly what a popcorn movie needs. Finally, I think the real hero of this film is not a daughter, nor a handsome guy, but a father? Count Dracula. The whole film is a story of his ability to get rid of his middle-aged crisis and psychological barriers and to regain the meaning and fun of life. This is precisely the most cheesy place in this popcorn movie.",movie

651,"I didn&#39;t want to look at such trivial things, but recently I have to hear &quot;Daddy Goes&quot; five times a day. Some companies even use it as a marketing theme. It seems that they don&#39;t look at the cavemen. It should be said that this program is really boring, but life is not boring. In this episode I watched, 5 pairs of fathers and sons went to the desert to take risks. A group of people skated on the sand dunes and skated, laughing and joking. At this time, Tian Liangâ€™s daughter asked her father to take her to play again. Tian Liang hesitated and felt that the sand dunes were too high and did not want to take the risk. Under the repeated demands of her daughter, Tian Liang had to pull the skateboard all the way to protect her daughter from sliding down. During this period, the sound suddenly calmed down, leaving only the soothing piano and daughter&#39;s cry. Time seems to be fixed at that moment, Tian Liang is in the same place, looking at his daughter, a touch of tempering from the boring suddenly burst like a volcanic eruption. In life, even the trivial little things will be magnified in the world of the mind. A man has been a son for decades, and one day he was suddenly called &quot;Dad&quot; by another child. The kind of shock, the kind of hardship, can only be understood by personal experience. This &quot;dad&quot; is really not easy. Itâ€™s a boring reality show, and itâ€™s fine to watch it occasionally, but itâ€™s a surprise tonight.",movie

In the past, I only saw how much I spent in the dreams of Xiaosi in high school. I clearly remembered that after reading more than 50 pages, I was not able to stand up with the dirty paper inside. The only impression of the bridge is that the woman is in a hurry to get on the taxi and says to let the car fly into the plane. So the small era is only the first few scattered pages, leaving the impression of two beautiful films built on aesthetics and emotions. Taking advantage of the mobile phone reading software to give me a free book for a month, I will complete the third part. When I was watching it, I said in my heart that Xiaosi was really a man. In addition to just taking a smile, the plot can no longer be a bloody point, and the writing is more tiring, and the others are all good. The more I read, the more I feel that the work of the small four-actor is very in place. The descriptions in the book and the appearances of the characters in the movie, the character, as if they are rooted, are tied in my mind, as if they were in the movie. It is alive.

653,"If it can be graded, the &quot;uniform&quot; that is being released should be a film that is restricted to a certain viewing range. At the very least, you can&#39;t mistakenly take a child to watch a movie. In the case of classification, the film can be placed in crime, horror movies, intentionally or unintentionally, this film also passed away with eroticism and sadism. But these seem to be secondary. The core of this film is crime. What kind of state is our sinful crime? Or, to trace the source of a retaliatory criminal, what kind of mental journey can we find? In the beginning, no one would want to get Chen Sicheng&#39;s insurance salesman Chen Ansheng, who will be the ultimate criminal behind the scenes. His faceless smile on the face of humans and animals will confuse many people, even including the detective Fangyou (played by Ren Dahua) and the young female police officer Yinger (played by Yan Xiaotong). At first they didnâ€™t think that there was so much hidden behind such a person. The secret. There is a saying in the workshop that &quot;the more honest and honest a man can&#39;t believe&quot;, Chen Naisheng is such a perverted killer, and he was teased by several &quot;white Fumei&quot; female classmates when he was a child, so that he thought he was &quot;the fate because of that.&quot; Malicious jokes have a lot to do with a complete change. In the climax of the film, Chen Ansheng and Fang Youweiâ€™s dialogues can reveal his psychology. He said: â€œI am willing to use the lives of several of them and my own life to exchange the moral conscience of this society. At the beginning of the crime, he never thought that he would eventually escape the legal sanctions, but he still had to do so. Under extreme inferiority and inbearance, explosive destructive forces often erupt; and the forbearance of such power can last for more than a decade. Chen Ansheng let Fang Youwei praise him, but Fang Youwei has always been jealous that he is a pervert. In this extreme way, did Chen Ansheng achieve what he called &quot;returning to social conscience&quot;? The answer is obviously no. When a person chooses to do evil, this person has turned into a devil. In the kind eyes, even if the devil is suffering again, it can&#39;t change the objective fact that the devil is the devil in people&#39;s eyes. We were once a carefree good boy. It is only in the tumbling giant of society that the trajectory of the individual&#39;s fate has changed. One day, when you realize that goodness is no longer, who is your goodness? The original meaning of the film &quot;Uniform&quot; is that Chen Ansheng likes to put the victims in various uniforms after committing crimes. Put aside this appearance, &quot;uniform&quot;Words may have such a deeper meaning. The detached detective of the singer is like a love between &quot;Bai Fumei&quot; Zhou Wei (played by Xu Ruo?), the old phone that Fang Youwei is reluctant to throw away and his own love story that he can&#39;t bear back. In addition to the main plot, this film is also set off to enrich a definition of &quot;society&quot; and &quot;life&quot;.",movie
654,"The script is quite good. There are no disgusting shots and tricks. Instead, I can get a glimpse of this ghostly and resentful mentality. The morbid grief and resentment of the sickness is very good, and it is terrible and sad. It was a great innovation at the time. Moreover, the interaction between the three protagonists is very lively and warm and humorous, and the strange and horrible conversion with the ghosts is natural and smooth. The smile of the hair is simply awesome, and Huang Baiming is very cute. I really like them and Ye Qianwen&#39;s threesome, if there is no ghost, it is estimated to be a very romantic love comedy. The only failure was the interpretation of the tragedy at the end and the sudden reversal. It was completely unrecoverable and disrupted the structure of the previous film. It was a bit nondescript. But in any case, this film was quite wonderful in the ghost film at the time, and it is also a bright spot.",movie
655,"Hearing that the medical Qinming series is good, the first two pieces were bought. The first &quot;The Corpse Man&quot; was very fluent, and the book of more than three hundred pages was quickly read. After returning to the test, he continued to watch the second one. The second part continues to tell a lot of bizarre stories and observe the ugliness of the world. Qin Ming has a saying, &quot;The dry forensic line is like a hurdle. Sometimes it is not the bloody and rancid smell on the scene, but the fragility of life and the complexity of human nature are so naked in front of you?&quot; ??? To be honest, I donâ€™t know how many hurries are going to be, I can only continue to exercise my heart.&quot; Yes, sometimes it is difficult to accept some scenes, and after the truth of the matter surfaced, the reality of human nature is indeed unacceptable. Many stories in the second part are like this. In the second part, Qin Ming has become the section chief. Even so, you will inevitably make mistakes in the forensic industry. Just like the wrong case, Qin Ming has made mistakes that are preconceived and not meticulous. His teacher criticized it. &quot;Just go, everyone said it is a murder case, so you also think that the murder case, but you forgot a forensic doctor should first figure out the death of the deceased. Because of the preconceived thinking, so You subjectively and arbitrarily ruled out the possibility of all accidents. The most terrible thing is that there is no detailed anatomy, and a clue that the back injury is so important. In fact, if you open the back of the deceased, your judgment will definitely change dramatically. In the case of the double corpse mystery case, although the teacher Yang Feng was killed, but his sexual assault was in front of the girl, Wu Wu was in order to give her daughter a head, Hong Zhengzheng was too much, but the original intention was also to repay Wu Wuâ€™s life-saving grace. In the end, who is a good person, who is a bad person, black and white, separated by a piece of paper, the difference between a thought. Zhao Yumo, the victim in the corpse of the forest, died of a stranger who believed in self-confidence and was too reliable. It was also a tragedy that died of her over-loving tutor. The case of the ancient court is also a matter of education. The murderer Xiaogui was only fourteen years old. After acknowledging the facts of the crime, he even said that he had finished speaking with Master Qin Ming. Can you go to school tomorrow, how can the child be educated? Good and bad things are not divided. Sometimes people encounter some grief, and after the initial pain and anger have passed, they must begin to accept this reality slowly. Maybe it&#39;s not something that you can do if you work hard. If things don&#39;t end as you want, then you have to learn to let go and continue to move forward. Like Qin Mingâ€™s wifeâ€™s bell,Her cousin was unpredictable at the age of the flower season, and the case was never detected. The family had no choice but to hide it in her heart. This case is also the Yuntai case. A case that runs through the second part. At the end of the book, after Qin Mingâ€™s long-term deliberation and inquiries, he finally broke it and let the victim sink into the snow and let the murderer get the response. Some punishments, so hard to break a case that has been deposited for many years, can be smashed under the constant efforts of Qin Ming. In addition to admiring Qin Mingâ€™s wisdom, he must be moved by his perseverance. The second part also learned that the work of the provincial department included a lot of administrative work, in addition to the daily identification, inspection and survey sites. For example, the training prepared by Qin Ming was busy for half a month. Sending notices, checking lists, contacting schools, making budgets, designing courses, making appointments, and being busy. There are also some problems in testing the body. For example, a good forensic doctor must be a good barber, because when examining the head damage, the hair of the deceased must be removed, and some lazy forensic doctors are not willing to shave, resulting in important damage not found. The important clues are therefore broken. The most difficult thing to shave is to shave the hair near the wound. There is also a phenomenon that the forensic doctor does not have a scam during anatomy. This is a different matter from the doctorâ€™s declaration of death. When the forensic doctor examines the corpse, it usually takes a few hours after the death of the deceased. It must wait until the corpse of the deceased, the corpse. Stiffness can be formed because it is an important indicator of the death. Forensic doctors, including the entrance to the sergeant, must see the signs of death in order to examine the corpse and cremation, so there is no possibility of &quot;dissecting the living and igniting the living.&quot; But listening to the author&#39;s description of some common sense is still a bit of a panic for me. In addition to Qin Ming, Dabao and Lin Tao are also frequent in the second part. For the scene that often appears on the disgusting scene, Dabaoâ€™s sentence is quite funny, saying that it can be exercised like the amount of alcohol. I think this is not something that ordinary people can exercise. Paying tribute to their work, paying tribute to their righteousness, and looking forward to the next one.",movie

What is actually &quot;Tencent practice&quot; of some basic theories and methods, so in addition to learning experience, it is also a test and deepening of theoretical knowledge, deepening your own understanding and understanding, very beneficial! Finally, I suggest that everyone look at this book, all dry goods. Moreover, the print quality and layout of the book is also very good, it can be regarded as an experiential detail.",movie
657,"After reading &quot;The Piano of Steel&quot;, I especially liked Qin Haijun. This movie is also because she played, so I think it should be seen. I saw that this film scored not low. After reading it, I felt that I was worthy of this score. Everything about youth seems to be in it. Probably the theme of youth movies is the growth. Every day when the test paper was inundated, the first love girl who was taken away by others, had no venting emotions, and was curious about all the unknowns in the world. We all have to go through it, and when everyone experiences it, they feel that they are so special, they are getting older, and one day, they find that they are acknowledging that they are only members of all beings, that all their pain and love are not higher than others. Slowly learn to cherish the people around you. I used to be afraid, afraid to reconcile with the world, and felt that this was a compromise to life and a surrender to fate. I don&#39;t think so now. Trying to understand other people&#39;s ideas is something that I feel very important now. Now I think the name of the man is very interesting. Actually, probably everyone of us is actually, actually gave up the beloved girl. Actually, the teacher who is roaring every day is also cute. Actually and the nasty classmates have been buddies, actually found that they liked it silently. My own girl is actually very good. It may be because, besides actually, other characters have some facial features, so they like it very much. He is rebellious, but not angry. After all, there must be such a person, turning us from silk into ordinary people and then learning to respect the world. From the perspective of watching movies, I feel that the story is clear, and there are some points that are unforgettable, but it is definitely a movie that looks comfortable. Therefore, I think that the movie is so good that it is about the right place and the right person, and can take the average score, perhaps the most important attitude.",movie
658,"This is the most entangled movie I have ever seen. The worry is that I always worry that the lie of Ripley, the poor boy, has been dismantled. At that moment, it is cruel to a poor person who is already low to the infinite corner. But what I am more entangled is that such a murderer, no matter how reasonable his motivation (not to mention unreasonable), how inferior his heart, he can always escape the French Open. He is a genius. He switches between the two roles. He deceives the police and the victim&#39;s father, fiancee, friends, and defrauds their trust. He is a killer to a woman who loves him and his loved one. Is such a person worthy of forgiveness? Perhaps everyone is excited about his psychological quality and machine change, and he is not flattered by the eyes of the rich. Is it also cheering for his murder? Ripley can live as a poor man. He has an elegant piece of art. He likes classical music, plays the piano, and he has the gift of imitation. He has nothing but money. However, he unfortunately received a rewarding job: to Europe to persuade a wealthy second generation to return to his father&#39;s side. What are the advantages of the rich second generation? Many things are related to money. Because of the rich, the rich second generation is generous because he does not consider a piece of bread to be half of the poorer, like the poor, because he gives half of himself I will be hungry. On the contrary, the rich second generation will give a lot of money to the poor friends, but this thousand gold does not necessarily have the weight of half the bread of the poor. When I was a child, my cousin moved to Chengdu, a poor girl from a foreign country. She couldnâ€™t go home at noon. She could only sway on campus. When she started to work as a bus, the driver would not remind the girl where to stand, so that she often sat. Pass the station. Once, she went to the local boy&#39;s house to be a guest, and the boy took her to play the King of Fighters. Surprise, the cousin accidentally broke a button, the cousin said, this is the most embarrassing and most cramped moment of her life, yes, just a button on the keyboard, will bring such a big Panic. This button that can&#39;t be played can even kill a person, just because she is completely at a loss. Fortunately, the boy is kind and trying to appease the little girl. This button is not as terrible as she imagined. My hair is small, I didn&#39;t have a colored pencil when I was young. At the last moment of the art class, he took the classmates to borrow the colored pencils. The terrible thing is that no one who usually plays with him lends him. He sees an unfamiliar girl. In his heart, she is a rich girl, they rarely Speaking, he walked past desperately to borrow a colored pencil from her. The childâ€™s psychology is fragile.The task has an inexplicable fear, just like the child who committed suicide a few days ago. On the occasion of my desperation, this unfamiliar girl happily lend him and let him complete the task. The rich have this power, and a small kindness can comfort a soul. These two stories are to say that Dick, who is rich in the second generation, is a good person in a sense. He did not do anything wrong with the poor Ripley. Dick&#39;s friend Freddy, who is also a rich man, insulted Ripley when he met Ripley, which insulted the pride of the rich, and even contained a protection for his friend Dick. Dick&#39;s girlfriend, Maggie, is better for Ripley, who always soothes him from the heart. Basically, our protagonist, every rich man Ripley encountered, is not bad. What is bad for him is just the fact that he is not soothing. Therefore, it is not necessarily a good thing that the poor have a local gold friend. Because the activities of the rich and the rich often inevitably are subject to the scrutiny of the upper class, even if the rich are a small charity, they cannot guarantee that they will get along with each other for a long time, and the souls of the poor will not be harmed. Ripley killed three people. The first time I killed Dick was an accident. The second time I killed Freddy was because of helplessness. The third time I killed Pete was the initiative. Ripley himself said, &quot;If a person kills someone, he will put the dark side into the basement. When he meets a special person, he will give him a key and say, come in. But you can&#39;t, because the basement is full of dirty, Devil... I think Ripley is more and more liked the life of the Dick-style rich, listening to classical music, watching opera, facing huge closets, placing art, and knowing that the house has been carefully renovated. The incomparably dark basement. Europeans say that it takes three generations to cultivate a nobleman. The so-called nobles are not so simple as money, they contain more things about quality and character, and the wealth of life will make a very small number of rich people. Pursuing a higher spiritual value, a more perfect personality, if Ripley is coming slowly, I think he will be a better rich man.",movie
659,"My dear baby, I am willing to give everything for you. This is the voice of every mom and dad. The same is true of the vampire Dracula, in order to protect the only daughter from being harmed by humans, and to build the &quot;Imperial Palace&quot; as her shelter. For the daughter&#39;s birthday, carefully planned, just to make her happy. But when children are always rebellious, they want to see the world outside, and Mevis is no exception. Dracula did not want to let his daughter down, so he promised, but behind the scenes, there is a deep fatherly love. In order to protect her daughter, Dad hired the &quot;workers&quot; to build a fake human village and pretend to be a vicious human. In order to let her daughter know the world outside is terrible, what Dad has done is for her safety. This is the scene that touched me in the first act. There will always be ups and downs in the movie, otherwise it will never be a good movie. Just when everyone thought that everything was back to normal, and to give birth to baby Mevis, the appearance of Jonny made everything messy. The human beings who entered the castle made Dracula panic instantly. However, Jonny made the birthday è¶´ more flamboyant and more memorable, made Mevis happier, and made Dracula a new change for mankind. When Jonny was taken away by Quasimodo, Dracula desperately wanted to save him. This was the scene that touched me in the second act. Vampires and humans, who say they can&#39;t coexist. (Ignoring the ghosts, this is not the point.) When Dracula told Jonny his story, Jonny seemed to understand, and could only leave this place silently, leaving his favorite Mevis. Jonnyâ€™s departure made Mevis sad, and Dracula, who is a father, must be more sad. He began to recall the scene after Jonnyâ€™s appearance, and finally made a great decision to get Jonny back. Let your baby daughter be happy! &quot;&quot;Baby, I always thought that the worst situation is that you left me. In fact, what makes me most sad is that you are not happy. When Dracula and his friends came to the human world, they found that humans were dressing up with them. This is the third time that touched me. I can describe it with harmony. When all the humans who dress up Dracula stand in the two rows and pull the cloak away, it is too domineering! The most touching and most touching is that Dracula needs to courage and persist in order to stop Jonny, regardless of the burning of the sun, or to fight for the plane. Everything is for the happiness of my daughter! This is a great father, a father who loves life.",movie
660,"I don&#39;t understand why the children of Douban must give such a low score, just as I don&#39;t understand why they want to give &quot;Huan Tai&quot; a high score. But what I want to say is that no matter what you think, this film is definitely the best movie of the year. No matter what war, it must be cruel, inhuman, and arduous. In recent years, human beings all over the world have experienced the most painful natural disasters. We cried and robbed the ground, because we were powerless in the face of such disasters, and we were very small; because we lost our loved ones and friends, it was difficult to reunite. Whether it is the Internet or the TV, the overwhelming news evokes the terrible earthquake and the fragility of human beings. However, we have forgotten in the age of peace. The most painful and heavy thing in this world is not a natural disaster like an earthquake, but a war of human inhumanity. So the Stalingrad defense war appeared in front of us. There has been a major earthquake in Russia. The search and rescue teams around the world can&#39;t help. Why did the scriptwriters choose not to choose other countries but only Japan, the defeated country of the Second World War? This is actually the peace advocate of the writer and the director. We are in a peaceful era, and every country is a member of the world family. We should unite for the suffering we have experienced. Forgive the mistakes of the ancestors, forget the hatred, remember the history, not kill each other, you fight for it. At the end of the film, the katakana neon lights on Japanese billboards flickered in the ruins. Excellent national treasure tenor singer also became a soldier? Yes, when the battlefield hits the doorstep, all you can do is give up your hobbies and dreams and plunge into the endless smoke. Artists are the ones who are least changed by the impetuousness of society, but the best in the war is destruction. War does not need sensation, no need to sigh, it needs to turn one after another delicate and sensible person into a cold and ruthless killing machine. There is no freedom of life and death, no freedom of love, everything has a behind-the-scenes manipulation. In the face of war, we are just puppets being picked up. Can German soldiers and Russian girls fall in love? If I throw this question now, you will definitely answer &quot;Don&#39;t be old! There is nothing wrong with it.&quot; However, the director told us that &quot;Don&#39;t be naive, nothing can be!&quot; Because it was the age of war, because it was both the enemy and the enemy. Even the multi-horned love of five soldiers and a Russian beauty has become logical. Love can&#39;t win any more. German amnesty said that he isThe real hero, the real hero is to fight for honor and victory, not to fight for revenge. This is a typical figure, he represents thousands of German soldiers. The will of a few people eventually became the killing of the majority, and the damn is the war. The Russian tenor also sang, &quot;I died in despair.&quot; The cruelty of war is that it never notices, maybe the person who is still with you this second will leave in the next second. You are always worried about not knowing where you will go tomorrow, or when it will end. Consuming, continuing... Everyone is struggling in the dark like a person who wants to sleep and doesn&#39;t dare to close their eyes. Remember how terrible the Russian soldiers crossed the Volga River? The Russian warriors who were burned by the raging fire rushed into the battle, and the German soldiers set a deep squat and fire in the trenches. Every victory is exchanged by countless volunteers. Let us pay tribute to the heroes who shouted &quot;fire at me&quot;! The movie is big and small. The building of several people is the Stalingrad of the entire nation. At this moment, the majestic soundtrack still echoes in my mind.",movie
661,"Some people seem to go very fast, but in fact he is advancing. He just dared to go. The last few episodes of the whole show are finished in one breath. This feeling is very good. After all, it is not easy to follow the drama. But now I feel that I am chasing this episode in an episode. It seems that I am going with the characters in the drama. The observation points at each stage are like the different stages of my life. In the middle of watching, I thought that Luo Weixin was much more fortunate than Joe. He has the world to accompany and help himself, and what he is born with is just a test of many choices one after another. Like thinking in the prison, many people can hardly accept the first thing, like Wang Sir chooses to commit suicide. But I can&#39;t die if I want to die, so I have to stand up and go once again. You see that he lost a family from the beginning and followed his mother back to the mainland. In fact, at the age of 18, I lost my family twice, and my brother and mother who couldnâ€™t reach it, couldnâ€™t recognize the dad who had the wrong impression. The only thing left is himself, but he still works as a policeman. A person came out. I did not expect to have so many obstacles to the police. Then he started another career, but he didnâ€™t have a girlfriend. He also encountered several financial turmoil, and there was no place to live. All the troubles have to go nowhere again, and really lose important people once... although the plot needs a little. But when a person walks a lot of people&#39;s life, it is still very emotional. If a person is lost before he gets it, where is the courage and conviction to catch up with the lost speed. Of course, at that time, we did not know that we were fortunate and fortunate. Some were just all attitudes. &quot;Qiao Tiansheng&quot; is actually a lot of people who are on the road. Many people discuss whether it is natural to do something very wrong, so it is not worth to forgive. Zhuo Jing is not too cold, so too worried. Luo Weixin is not too selfish, so I have wasted Yao Wenying&#39;s youth for more than ten years. In fact, he is just a good person. Is the character change too sudden, is the protagonist&#39;s line illogical or the character really so ridiculous... The protagonist in the story doesn&#39;t care too much, probably because the fast-forward time has played down part of everyone&#39;s attachment. But the audience still can&#39;t open it, probably because the viewer actually stays in life. Some experience experiences are there or are seen by people around you, so it is true. We cling to other people&#39;s mistakes because they don&#39;t want to make mistakes or already have them. Just like myself, I shared my little feelings and thoughts in the discussion. Just like just seeing the ending, everyone is skeptical, for example, when Zhuo Jing saw the prestige and was born on the side of the road.The indifference shown does not care, as if he really has no feelings with that person. Even if I feel sad, but thinking of Zhuo Jing is really a dead heart, there is no way to say. I saw that he was born in the detention room and told his father that for the first time in many years, you talked like a father. At the end of the day, he naturally said to his uncle, who cares about his own chicken legs. You are really feeling that many things are still obsessed before, and naturally unravel in time. &quot;Giant Wheel&quot; has passed too much time and contains too many lives. It wants to resonate, you and I have it. After reading it, I couldn&#39;t help but share these little feelings. In addition to seeing the real news, thinking and curious to think of what I have been involved in and what I have been trying to explore, are actually the world in my eyes.",movie
662,"There is a river in the heart of Li An. When there is a river in the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the American audience sees a river in the movie. The Chinese audience sees a river in the movie. Li Mubai&#39;s rivers and lakes have narrow sense of righteousness and justice. Yu Xiulian&#39;s rivers and lakes are sinister and cruel, and Yujialong&#39;s rivers and lakes have stimulating temptations. This is really a thousand viewers with a thousand Hamlet. In fact, I am not sure what Li Anâ€™s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon wants to show. He always wants to talk and stop, never likes big sadness, and does not explain his work in detail, letting the officials read it himself. The relationship between Li Mubai and Yu Xiulian is easy to interpret. The two ruthless people have never been able to confide in the ritual and morality. Until the last moment of life, Li Mubai finally used the last breath to express his confession and admitted that he has always loved Xiulian. The relationship between Yu Jiaolong and Luo Xiaohu is somewhat confusing. The two men on the Gobi are free to let go of all the constraints and freedom of movement. However, after Luo Xiaohu found Beijing, the reaction of Yu Jiaolong was very cold. When Xiaohu snatched the pro, Yu Jiaolongâ€™s performance did not seem to be anxious or resentful. Anyway, she did not go to Luo Xiaohu after she escaped from the wedding. On the Wudang Mountain, Yu Jiaolong jumped down without hesitation, leaving the tiger to grieve, and the tiger seemed to understand why his little dragon jumped. . . . . The relationship between Li Mubai and Yu Jiaolong is the most difficult to say. They are completely different. They may have seen different skys through each other. They eventually returned to their original fate with a different mood. In fact, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not as good as Li Anâ€™s later film, but it is still necessary to admit that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is better than hero, eternal, and ambush, because there are different human feelings. Just some time ago I went to Hongcun and Mukeng Zhuhai, so I only looked for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Although the drifting of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not true, it is really beautiful. Finally, I have to say that Tan Dunâ€™s music is too good.",movie
663,"Li Anâ€™s heart is very heavy. Li Anâ€™s mind is very evil. His movie never laughs and laughs, but it always makes you cry and feels distressed. After Angâ€™s filming in the United States, he never had the opportunity to display his talents, so he almost always relied on his wife to support him. However, he never gave up his ideals. In order to be able to film his own movies, he looked for the work of the Treasury, just to have time to write the script. Later, he participated in the script game in Taiwan. The second place in the competition was Li Anâ€™s promoter. The first place was Li Anâ€™s wedding reception. It should be said that until the wedding banquet, Li An was really a big red, and the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain behind him made him a master of Hollywood. The story of the wedding banquet is very interesting and real. Everyone&#39;s thoughts can find a particularly good reason for formation, and they can evoke understanding and resonance, but careful analysis has factors of selfishness. Parents&#39; forced marriage, forced wedding, and forced birth are all in the name of love, but this love becomes a heavy burden. It is terrible and sad to do the filial piety in the name of love. But it is so Helpless, because parents are not happy, but they are really love, really think that this is the best love, really has formed a deep-rooted concept in their own bones, they are willing to sacrifice everything for their children, But when they don&#39;t need a life-and-death decision, they must have their children obey themselves. Liberation is difficult. If I remember correctly, Zhao Wen? It seems to be the wedding banquet of Maoâ€™s self-recommended performance, and it really made a name for himself through this drama. Lang Xiong and Gui Yalei are the old team of Li An. The acting skills have not been said. The tacit understanding of the old manâ€™s wifeâ€™s investment is not in place. The impression is that the old man is running back, the old lady handing the medicine, the old man drinking. The water swallowed, and the mouth said it was entirely a wedding thing, true and natural. Gao Jinsumei was only Jin Sumei at that time. She was already famous in Qiong Yaoâ€™s TV series. I was very strange when she had a mouth in the film. How to talk with her before was completely different. It felt very unnatural and very artificial. Later I realized that she played The Shanghainese who went to the United States from the mainland, but she is just abandoning the Taiwanese, and speaks the words of Mandarin, which is still different from the Shanghai girl. A few years ago, she was keen to ask the government to solve the people&#39;s livelihood issue or the horse, and it has not sounded in recent years.",movie
664,"If it is not the success of the film, I will not strongly recommend it. After reading it, itâ€™s really a big hit. Itâ€™s been a long time since I didnâ€™t have a pure commercial film that made me look so pleasing, and Iâ€™m really sure to say that I have to go to the Douban score. This is not a Nolan-style brainstorm. The director has guided the battle of the gods, so don&#39;t take the idea of â€‹â€‹watching deadly magic to treat the horror. Let go of your thoughts and profoundness. Don&#39;t be a smart audience. Don&#39;t be tempted to slap the director&#39;s heart. Just watch a fun and beautiful movie. The horror squad can definitely meet the above needs. There is nothing to say in the story, there is nothing to say about acting, and a famous star is starring, it is worthy of the fare! No one else said, Emma Fisher&#39;s previous film did not have a single I can see, she felt that she always played a brainless woman, and a vicious circle, and this time finally did not bother me, the priestess. The identity of the tarot card is related to the task in the group. It is better if you think more about it. I am afraid that some people do not think that the pseudo-Cro is a must to die, because his card is death. At the end, there are actually slots, so I donâ€™t nitpick. After all, it still brings me a pleasant audio-visual experience on the weekend. After reading it, I went straight to the new world for 60 hours without making a contribution.",movie

667,"The type of &quot;Stalingrad&quot; marked on IMDB is action, war, which is misleading of red fruit. It is probably derived from the consistent sloppyness of &quot;foreign&quot; movies on American websites. They often mark Italian police films as erotic, and Chinese martial arts films. Marked as horror, this kind of carelessness is often cited in Russian movies. However, the Russian producers of Stalingrad have catered to this misleading, especially in the trailer. Usually, for the advertising effect, the trailer is a highlight of the highlights in the movie, and the notice of &quot;S&quot; is intensified, and all the wonderful and less exciting war shots of the film are exhausted. In other words, when you watch the film, in addition to the drama, all the visual impacts?? Soldiers fight, gunfire, aircraft skimming, tank arrays, and even those aerial shots overlooking the broken wall? I have seen it in the trailer. Even if it is a trailer that takes the eyeball as its own responsibility, it has never seen such a hard work. Probably the only role is to facilitate the audience to experience the heavy upgrade from the computer TV screen to IMAX3D, which is very helpful as a promotional device for cinema equipment. There is a plot, the woman asks, what are we doing here, the man answers, waiting for the end of terror, waiting for the war. Based on this, I feel that the director probably has his own abacus, diluting the positive description of the battle, reducing the distracting effect of the bells and whistles, perhaps guiding the audience to pay more attention to the emotional direction of the character, witnessing the destruction of human nature by war, and thus experiencing the suffering of the soul. The life is not as good as death, conveying the anti-war motif of &quot;the battlefield is a kind of relief.&quot; This idea is not bad. The atmosphere before waiting is also enough to suppress, but the audience expects to see a wonderful showdown. The long wait is only a little sporadic flame, and it is worthless. Not to mention that there is not enough tension in the waiting. In addition to that birthday party, the woman blows out the candle, the tenor sings a song, and the hot tub is ready, which makes me a little touched. Most of the time, they just missed some old things and couldn&#39;t let me change into emotions. Only when witnessing the innocent death of a person can inspire the indignation of the screen, but even such a formulaic emotional movement is too little and too little. To say a thousand and ten thousand, it is still a disaster caused by insufficient funds. The Russian film industry can actually save money. The millions of concocted &quot;The Night Watchman&quot; is amazing in the world. It is a precedent, but the war film burns far more than the urban magic film. It builds several equal proportions and uses 3D cameras. I have to spend seven or eighty-eight, and I have to blast and have to tank and have to crash.The oil depot, 30 million US dollars how to use enough, you can only get a little bit of everything, like a taste, like some of the buffet restaurant&#39;s exquisite dishes, taste delicious, but eat a few mouthfuls. Before the film was released, many comments on the movie website said that 30 million US dollars could be used in this scene (watching the trailer), enough for Zhang Tu Feng to guide the flow of several lessons, and after watching the positive film, it is estimated that they can not swallow the words back. However, there is a little trailer that is not lying. The slow motion of the film is unprecedented, and it is in line with the notice. The use of slow motion in war movies is extremely rare. There is only one precedent in the memory of the author, the violent aesthetic master Sam Pekin&#39;s Iron Cross. However, Master Pei is a mortal. The &quot;Medal of the Medal&quot; can be easily copied. Even Wu Yusen, who is a teacher of Pei Jinfa and prefers to play bullets, does not dare to use slow motion. Wu is well aware of the huge risks of Dong Shiâ€™s effectiveness. &quot;Stalin Green&quot; is piled up in slow motion. Some places do have aesthetics. For example, the Cannons of Cannon remind me of the jungle bombing of &quot;Detective Sherlock Holmes 2&quot;, but most of the time, people only hate to fast forward. Perhaps the director believes that playing is already scarce enough, and it is necessary to slow down to extend the length of the conflict. With a lot of slow motion, the tone can&#39;t be realized. The whole film is like a Wu Yusen gun battle film. The woman walks in the room. The bullets are rubbed and fell on the wall. They bloom like a pond, and they are more bloody than the hero. &quot;, there are no surprises. When the two armies fought and rushed into the front, the butt of the guns and the fists and feet were all flying, and all were promoted, and there were funny and fierce tactics. The musician daggers attacked the German soldiers. From the action design to the lens scheduling, the film is like a kung fu movie. If you change to the face of Donnie Yen, you can directly put it at the beginning of &quot;Jingwu Fengyun Chen Zhen&quot;. The opening of the story has some meanings. From the earthquake rescue, the topic of &quot;five fathers and one mother&quot; was brought to the fore. The key role of the German side is a senior officer, and a Russian son-in-law who is similar to Monica Bellucci in the Sicilian Beauty Legend (the same as the US for the Germans, the same lines are scarce). The balance between the two sides is balanced, trying to achieve a historical narrative without bias. But I am not satisfied with the molding on both sides. In the Soviet Union, it is like a &quot;narrative&quot; documentary produced by the History Channel. Who are they, how they live, how much they have done, and their hobbies, they all use narration to say that they are too blunt in the narrative, saying that they are remembering historical figures (not knowing this) Do you really have a few?The people) are not enough. Even if they let them chat with women, they will say it better than this.",movie
668,"To say that the most recent TV show is the hottest, &quot;Where is Dad?&quot; Is it so hot? Some people think that it is the star effect, the warmth of family, the pressure of work, the prevalence of the absence of the father and so on. In my opinion, the reason why &quot;Daddy goes there&quot; is high, the reason is very simple, there are so many points: 1, more cute points; 2, more laughs; 3, more moving points, all bad after reading The mood will be diluted by the full positive energy. Recently, the cartoon &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; on the mainland court also contains the above three points. &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; brings together some of the most popular monsters in the world. In addition to Dracula, there are &quot;Frankenstein&quot; Frankenstein, Werewolf, Invisible Man and Mummy? They are in the film and ordinary. Like people, they each have their own family, but also have their own troubles, such as the wolf father is troubled by that nest of mischievous wolf babies. This setting is very interesting in itself, giving a humanized imagination to the other side of the monsters we have never seen before. &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; also have a lovely side, and it seems that the global animation production trend is popular in such a &quot;re-deconstruction&quot;, such as the domestically produced most cattle animation &quot;Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf&quot;, and Disney&#39;s &quot;Invincible Destruction King&quot; at the end of last year, the arrangement of the opposite corner The ideas are roughly the same. After the humanized processing of these geeks, the results are what we are seeing now, they become more cute! Draculaâ€™s exaggerated facial expressions from time to time, Frankensteinâ€™s various stupid and cute expressions, and a series of funny scenes that Johnâ€™s integration into the monster group brought uniqueness to the audience outside the screen. Creative comedy look. As the director Gundi Tarkovsky said in an interview: &quot;I will show some of the good pieces to my children, their eyes are the embarrassing boss, I think the most important here. One thing is that no one expects a cartoon to tell a serious topic, we just want to get the most out of it.â€ The smile of this film caters to younger children, and also takes care of the needs of the older audience for irony and humor. When Dracula was blushing and blushing because of human beings&#39; poor cosplay, when the movie &quot;Twilight&quot; appeared on the TV screen, I believe that even the audience who picks the four will be arranged in such an unexpected humor. Surprised. As a cartoon with a spirit of spoofing, I donâ€™t forget to ridicule myself and ridicule other famous films.It stems from life and is derived from the keen comedy cells of the founders. In the second half of the film, the smile reached a blowout. For example, the words &quot;Run! Dracula! Run!&quot; really made the fans smile. Of course, behind this series of laughter is inseparable from the plot. The plot of the film is quite simple. It is about a story of a father who is too much in love with his daughter and who has a strong desire to control. After meeting the young John, he realizes his own problems and changes his way of loving his daughter. The main family card is an essential element of the Hollywood Family Carn movie. Among them, the father&#39;s love has become a theme of love in the animation industry in recent years. The theme of &quot;Brave Legend&quot; and &quot;Daddy Daddy&quot; are all about fatherly love. The core character of the film, Dracula, redefines this classic vampire image for a new generation of viewers. Before that, we have seen all kinds of Dracula, but he is a father&#39;s side, bringing a different kind of novelty to the audience, and even giving this character a new meaning. He belongs to a kind of crazy arrogant person, but at the same time contains a lot of fun. In this film, Dracula, the father, turned his thoughts from stubborn to enlightened. Through this lively character, it will bring a lot of inspiration to the children of the growing children and their parents. In addition, the depth of the film is another conflict point and an implied love story. Humans are disgusted with monsters and monsters. They are no longer a new setting in spoof animation. The &quot;Shrek&quot; series has brought such conflicts to the fullest, but &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is advancing with the times. This film adds a portrayal of human modernization and civilization to this conflict point. The rock music festival, the cosplay animation festival, and the modern saga of the photos are all filled with the brand of our era. The love element is the most touching part of the film&#39;s father and daughter. Here, the readers who have not yet watched the film will feel it. If you look up, the innovative spirit behind The Elf Hostel is worth a book. The freedom of creation of Hollywood filmmakers has always made their film industry always alive. For example, the purely typed films of western films and vampire films encounter the so-called bottleneck period. After the development of the previous routines, their filmmakers know how to find another way to inherit the type of clothes and continue to shoot. For example, Tim Burton&#39;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; is a rehearsal of vampire themes in a comedy way. weAlways feel sorry for the phenomenon of &quot;cultural faults&quot;. There have been so many excellent masterpieces in domestic animation. How can anyone continue to do it later? Is everything due to the fact that the creative environment is not as free as other places? However, good works are not blocked by the constraints of the surface. In recent years, the global popular use of spoof, humorous comedy to redo some subjects, to do something a bit hodgepodge, can be said to be a certain degree of unthinking, but from another angle of thinking, this is also a historical review form. After the time is ripe, these types of films will recreate the classics in some form! Domestic animation requires other works that have ideas like &quot;Ten Thousands of Jokes&quot;. It is the essence of animation and comedy that is traced back to the source and advancing with the times.",movie
669,"The time that was forgotten in the five years that was stolen left the pain to vanish. If you can make your memory only stay in good memories, I believe that everyone is willing to go back to those years, always want to forget that unhappiness is the hope of every coupleâ€™s dreams, quarreling When you don&#39;t have to turn over the old books, there are no more grievances, and love is crystal clear and clear in the forgotten. &quot;The five years that I was stolen&quot; is a relatively sincere film in Chinese love movies. The story is very good, and there are small surprises in the narrative. The whole movie is full of emotions, although the story is not new but the director is A little bit of heartfelt thoughts, it is a tragicomedy, the audience can feel the feelings of the characters with the ups and downs of the plot. The biggest problem of Chinese love movies for a long time is that they can&#39;t cause the audience to share the same feelings. The film director is relaxing. The tone of love shows the reason why love is beautiful. After all the impurities are removed from love, the original unhappiness disappears, and it is difficult to see the emotions that the two have retained. As a film of love, there is a tear in the film. The effect expected by the director is basically reflected in the film, but the gap between the film and the classic is also obvious. The traces of the plot to cater to the public psychology are obvious, and the fear is offended. The audience, failed to come up with a more convincing plot to achieve a love story, perhaps the director did not want to make the film a classic, then we are not too demanding on the film. Frankly speaking, although I donâ€™t like male starring Zhang Xiaoquan, I prefer the heroine Bai Li, but basically I wonâ€™t have any prejudice against the actors. Just like the whole plot setting, the performance of the two actors is also quite satisfactory. A little bigger, her performance has the traces of the past roles, especially &quot;Love for 33 Days&quot;. Unfortunately, Beijing&#39;s taste is too strong, and it seems to be a bit misplaced with this fresh character. The line is the biggest problem for Chinese actors now. Film and television actors often do not work hard on the lines, and the results will ultimately affect the quality of the film. It must be said that few Chinese love films are seen, but &quot;The Five Years Stolen&quot; is still a movie worth seeing.",movie
670,"Since Disney acquired Pixar in 2006, the original three-legged animation market has become the current two dragons, and the loss of competitors has not caused us any loss to these audiences. Instead, Pixar is in the new home. Under the aura, he continued to exude his dazzling light and the disease never faded. This allows us fans who are looking forward to seeing animated films on the big screen to have a good eye. One or two cartoons from Disney and DreamWorks are rising in quality every year. This made me start thinking about the subtle relationship between competitors and competitors. In this game of fast-handed Ashura, Ashura and the Destruction King are enemies of each other. They are competitors. One goal is to destroy the entire building. The other goal is to repair all the destroyed places. They live like this for generations, harmonious and beautiful. If the wrecked king does not participate in a party that does not belong to him, if he does not spend the mind for the so-called gold medal that can prove anything, this game will It has been going on like this in an endless stream. But this is not the case. When the wrecking king complains time and time again that he is working endlessly and his own negative role, he only wants to leave this place, find another place to prove himself, and then let himself be dignified. There is a glorious life, like a positive character, or so he left, but he will not know that the place he left is called heaven. A familiar sentence, in fact, what I want to say is that the place where each of us lives is a paradise. We have come to the present position in the wrong place. Each of us is actually the protagonist in this life. The protagonist at work. We may be tired of our current life one day, want to escape, and want to leave. I feel that my place of work is too dull. I donâ€™t have any intentions to go to work every day. We want to break such a rule and look for a new place to work. We feel that our living environment is not good, we feel that people around us are not good, and our neighbors are noisy. Crazy want to escape to another so-called better place; we dislike that our partner is not good, get used to a life of stability, feel that the days of two people are too common, not vigorous, not sloppy, not looking To the passion of love, I always look for opportunities to find new stimuli, new partners. Each of us is the invincible king of destruction in our lives. We want to do our own way to destroy our calm life.To destroy the hard-won good environment, try various ways to destroy it and destroy a fairy tale we live in. We began to toss, began to leave this place, went to a place that I felt right, until we finally found that there was no place to compare with the original place, the person who left the original is the most suitable person. The place where I lived was called paradise. So who made us make these changes? Of course, subjective factors come from ourselves, and objective reasons cannot be separated. The cartoon tells us that the people who finally let the wrecking king leave are the people living in the building that he destroyed day and night. Ah Xiu is not enemies with him because he knows what kind of relationship they are, no one. This game must be powered. Those who are not sensible are the residents and the masses. They are not only unclear, they have to take action, they are omnipotent to prove their own right and others&#39; mistakes, and they do not know that they themselves are full of loopholes. We are not like this in our lives, the endless complaints around us, the constant lingering on the Internet and the so-called good words of our colleagues. When we know that those who persuaded others to have their own words have a good job, those unscrupulous writers who persuaded women to leave old love and find true love originally had a happy family, and people who persuaded people to leave their hometown lived in their hometowns. When we were so good, we realized that we were not a sober person. So what should we do? A good movie will not only give us questions, but also let us find the answer. So I prefer the female captain: carry out his duties to the end, even the bugs in the foreign domain must be exhausted, loyal to the duties while not tired of the boring life, and will pay attention to the small surprises around. Because don&#39;t worry, all your own arrangements, instead of trying your best to fight for things that shouldn&#39;t belong to you, it&#39;s better to take every step of your footsteps, live, and give you the surprise you want.",movie
671,"Itâ€™s gratifying that the peopleâ€™s film critics treat the same on the bad film. At least let the so-called famous directors in China clearly understand that the Chinese fans are not foolishly worshipping foreigners, and we are slamming us for the bad film. Can make a bowl of water flat. People who have seen &quot;Life in the Head Down&quot; can basically imagine what kind of story it is when the film&#39;s poster is shown. It is because of the infinite ambiguity of the students&#39; imagination and the filming of the film. After years of serious curiosity, I opened the film. The director must have spent a lot of time at the beginning, imagining how to build such a world in order to let the audience forget the classic little movie as much as possible, and not forget all that small movie is profitable. The first five minutes are full of imagination, the huge structure and the unparalleled and subversive worldview, which makes people wonder how wonderful stories will happen. In such a world, countless things can happen, and countless things are unexpected. However, the director has staged a story that can happen anywhere in this vacant world, and everything is This naturally happened, all our curiosity and all the surprises, all swayed, like a mermaid mouth, suddenly found that this thing has no legs. The rotten film is destined to be a mess. It seems to be challenging our physiology and humanity. The time we try to find the exclusive memory for the young man, on the other hand, it is still difficult for the conservative cameraman to stagnate. We even hope that this story will happen on the ground. A girl has lost her memory. Her childhood is trying her best to help her recover her memory. The last two people can be together again. Good story, two people, the big brother, you have lost a memory, even now, you have to treat another person with a big head down. I am even more curious about the fact that they wonâ€™t catch fire when they kiss. When they hug, what are they wearing? How do they solve the waistband ooxx? Why didn&#39;t you fly and then lose memory when ooxx? All the curiosity is bigger than the movie itself, so that after watching the movie, I have to spend a period of time to check how much the odds of the two countries have been lost. In the end, I ended up sleeping. At the end of the film, the hero and the hero are meeting in the lower world. People in the upper world drink a blush drink. The two layers are finally able toFrom the past, we can finally appreciate the beauty of the heroine on the same plane. Finally, I can&#39;t help but think that it would be great for the two people in this movie to stay like this. . .",movie
672,"At the same time, I also read the Tibetan Book of Life and Death. They accompanied me through the once fragile moments of the previous week. At that time, I was full of thoughts. After the plane was late, I stopped at the airport and went to another city. I was hungry all the way, arrived at the hotel room where I stayed, and watched before going to bed. Feel the compassion of the Guru and the Buddhas, the irritations that were nowhere to be placed, the negative emotions of loneliness and helplessness were all smoothed out. Let&#39;s summarize the two together. The following are the reading notes of the time. SogÃ© Rinpoche said that most people only cherish life at the moment of dying, citing the words of the lotus ambassador: &quot;Those who believe that they have enough time are ready to die at the end of the dying. Then they are upset. Isn&#39;t it too late?&quot; Most people today are unprepared when they die, and they are not prepared when they are alive. What is more chilling than this phenomenon? He told us not only about how to face death, but more importantly how to treat life. In modern society, each of us has a job-making job, and many people are bound by the career of nine and six nights. Over time, they feel that life is meaningless. He said that our mission is to strike a balance, find the middle way, learn not to indulge in the enjoyment of modern life, the key is to be simple, not to extend yourself too much by outside activities, but to make our life easier. There are many common points between the two books, such as the mention of &quot;impermanence.&quot; Pemma Chuzhuo, author of &quot;Transfer to Adversity,&quot; said that the Buddha believes that life has three qualities. Impermanence - Nothing is static or fixed, and everything is impermanent is the first mark of life. We can&#39;t resist this fact, but it is always difficult to treat it with an optimistic attitude. Because impermanence means change, it means that there are gains and losses. When we get good feelings, we always expect it to last forever. We are eager to have a steady sense of security, even for our own skin. The face, the people who accompany me, the affection, the friendship, the love, all hold such hopes. Although I will admit that the world is impermanent when I talk about it, I canâ€™t really accept the truth. Itâ€™s hard to live in the present and cherish it. She encourages us to learn to gradually relax, because we will always live in a transitional period, and if we can easily face it, it will be fine. No me - this is the second mark of life. No me is not the same as no self. If so, it is the loss of personality. But we often experience what we have done wrong.Good encounters are too serious, we feel that we are too important, and one problem will follow. We always rationalize our troubles. Self-importance often hurts ourselves, because at this time we will limit the problem to a narrow world of likes and dislikes. She taught us to awaken Bodhicitta, the nourishment that nourishes the soul. Each of us is unique, but we must not be too stubborn to adhere to &quot;I am this appearance, you are this virtue&quot;, we are not the person in the eyes of others, or a person in my own eyes, can not be deeply involved, Inextricable. Bitter - the third mark of life. She quoted Suzuki&#39;s words as saying that only through a series of happy or unpleasant tests can she gain real power. Accepting pain is born with it. Living this understanding is creating the necessary conditions for happiness. We often misunderstand this way. For example, we mistake the pain as happiness. The moths rushed to the ground, trying to find a moment of comfort, but ruining their more precious things. Repeatedly and repeatedly, it becomes a vicious circle. These three laws are often memorized in my heart. It tells me that I will no longer deliberately enjoy and avoid suffering, work hard to relax, and live in the present. PS: I want to praise the translator&#39;s translation skills. She is a beautiful and talented woman! As her ex-husband Li Wei said, if there is a new woman, beautiful and wandering, charming and confused, and excellent and excellent, sad and sexy, incomprehensible and unreasonable, must not be others, is Hu Yin dream. As the first beauty in Taiwan in the past, she is both good at writing and familiar with translation. She is not only interested in performance work, but also participates in environmental protection and public welfare. The unexpected annihilation of various causes has provided an opportunity for her personal spiritual growth. Hu Yin dream said: &quot;Be able to choose every aspect of life on the ground, with the most tolerant care, allowing life to manifest itself naturally, in order to become more harmonious, more and more free from the realm of nothing.&quot; This quotation is like her motto &quot;normal heart.&quot; worth learning.",movie
673,"The author of &quot;New Yorker&quot; in Beijing, Peter Heisler, Chinese name He Wei, is divided into two parts. The first part is about his experience of traveling along the Great Wall, and the second part is reflected by the peasant Wei Ziqi. A portrayal of the lives of Chinese rural people. The book review of this book, as Chai Jing said, said that He Wei wrote about China and the kind of sorrow and grief that we turn a blind eye to. It is rare to see a foreigner who is so fond of research in the Chinese countryside. His meticulous observation and objective grasp of historical details made me awe-inspiring again and again. As an author, no presupposition is his best position. The cover of the book is a fake policeman on the side of the road. Just like the various forms of formalism in China, it is clearly standing there, but it is ineffective and cannot help solve any problems. In the book, He Wei interspersed the motor vehicle driver&#39;s theoretical test questions, I laughed awkwardly, and most of the topics singularly reflected the essence of formalism. As mentioned in the book: If other drivers are parking to ask you for directions, you should: A) not tell the other party. B) Answer patiently and meticulously. C) Give him a wrong path. Before driving, the driver: A) can drink a small amount of B) can not drink alcohol C) can drink beer, but can not drink other alcohol. As a leader of Chinese documentary literature, He Wei&#39;s delicate observations show China that we are familiar but not familiar with. The truth of his writing of the ball-bill system is that forgiveness is much simpler than ex ante permission, and the difference in toasting etiquette is written in the banquet. It is enough to say that I want to drive in the United States, but it is difficult to deny in China. Written in the rural areas of China, the grain is sun-baked on the road, the whole village only has the elderly and children, and in order to obtain the World Bank loan, the excavation pits on the roadside are only five bags of cheap and hard-cut halal beef noodles. There are three villages, the natural &quot;stupid&quot; of the fool, the fake ID card of the working girl, etc. In fact, many of the things he wrote are all over the day, but when we read this paragraph, Always touch the bottom of my heart. He is in contact with the most ordinary Chinese, from their perspective to reflect the changes of modern China. In a sense, he is right. As he said, only the majority of ordinary Chinese people have truly changed their lives, which can explain the whole of China. Whether it really changed, and where it changed. I appreciate the author&#39;s civilian perspective and black humor. There are a lot of descriptions in the book that I can&#39;t help but laugh at, but there is a hint of laughter. The gesture of his outsiders, to be coldA quiet and objective experience to understand another country, a nation, a region&#39;s habits and culture, often more than we can find details, because as a Chinese, we have long been accustomed to these phenomena. It can only be said that China&#39;s towns and villages are more than adequate, but civilization is still insufficient. The book portrays a somewhat exaggerated and worrying situation in China, but it does not blame it on anyone&#39;s head. In fact, it is not the dictatorship of the Chinese government. What he presents is a characteristic that everyone in the changing China will have and is difficult to remove: &quot;Sometimes, they seem to instinctively grasp the worst things in the two worlds: the worst modern life, the most A bad traditional concept. &quot;The turbulent and disconnected, both fast forward and the original step, the swing is not the opposite. What I admire most is that, as a journalist, when he combines the details of the incomprehensible, embarrassing, embarrassing, and chilling things he observes, he presents a worrying but not feeling weak and completely weak. Rejuvenating the dark scene, because he did not make any comments, try to be close to the people, try to integrate into the lives of local people, stop and chat with them, and carefully pay attention to what kind of state they are in life. On the other hand, many newspapers and magazines in China are trying to dig into the rural towns and villages to find out the details. Unfortunately, many reports make people feel lack of vitality. Maybe they really pay too much attention to the details, and forget to pay attention to those people in the details, and then a piece. After the comments came out, the idea of â€‹â€‹seeking common ground while reserving differences seemed a little far-fetched. The true learning is always in the people, not to ponder, not to question, to observe life with your own eyes, far better than to appease the social well-known interests of some flying heads. End with the author&#39;s sentence: In China, losing direction is not a bad thing, because other people don&#39;t know where they are going.",movie
674,"I have been reading this book for a long time, ten years, whether it is the understanding and grasp of the industry, or its own growth and understanding, is a short period of time. As she replayed nearly a decade of events in China, I took time to look back at the TV interviews of that year, and each of the stories inside was so impressive. Although there are many stealing characters, such as Chen Yu, who has the captain&#39;s temperament, such as Cui Yongyuan, who has a needle in the cotton, such as Lao Fan Lao Hao and Snoopy who accompanied her all the way, Chai Jing is more and more outstanding. Because she has been arguing for self-examination in these years, the young and sturdy temper is calm and watery in all kinds of running-in, and more importantly, the group of people who point her up from time to time. What kind of self, what kind of circle I met. Work with people who have courage, and read from no words. She said that when she was in her early twenties, she interviewed Huang Yongyu and asked him what his philosophy of life is. Huang answered &quot;ordinary.&quot; Chai Jing, who is in her twenties, doesn&#39;t understand. I thought, is this also called philosophy? . The old man said, &quot;There are so many high-ranking children in the sky, why do the Seven Fairies want to marry Dong Yong? Because she has everything, it is only unusual.&quot; When she was in her twenties, she tended to invest in the interview, subjective Beyond the objective, such as the truth that she finally realized, the truth is often lost in tears. Accuracy is the best defense. It is also because of this sentence that I will not easily comment on a person&#39;s behavior or express a view on one thing. Behind every subtle news, there is a long chain of logic hidden. Often, I have not yet reached the middle of the mountain. I have already moved the content described in it, bitter and deep, or tears. Whenever there will be angry youth, I once laughed with a friend, and people are not angry and young. But after that period, I looked at various news reports, how many scenes were devastated, how hot the situation was, how murderous the murderer was, and I still felt heartbroken, but I would not be so fiercely judged or attached. Put it in life again, I will not be angry with people or things that I canâ€™t understand. If I canâ€™t get along with it, I will walk away. If I have to be with him, I will only say the values â€‹â€‹of the other person and I donâ€™t. In the same way, I will not arbitrarily chew the tongue, as if I am advertised how much I love. A lot of things during this time made me understand that there really is no immutable concept, and there will be no people you are permanently disgusted. What is more, I found that I once dismissed the idea, one day I suddenly felt that it was actually I am forgiven, one day I became the one I used to be.The kind of person who hates it. But who can say it clearly? Just as Chai Jingâ€™s sentiment after interviewing the Suichuan earthquake, only those who have experienced the boundless darkness are qualified to say that I understand you. More than two months ago, I just had a lot of blood after I ended my trip. I always felt that the best time was on the road. At that time, Miss C said that you would not think so after a month. I am angry that I don&#39;t believe it. When I was chatting with V in the office after a night of overtime, I suddenly remembered Miss C&#39;s words, and then I suddenly felt that time is the best validator. At this point I think, wherever there is life elsewhere, where life is the same. No matter how far I walked up the bag, I will still be stable. I watched the sweet little girl talking to her boyfriend on the crowded subway. I watched a tired office worker grab the subway handrail and was sleepy. Walking on the bustling streets, through the arrogant high-rises, through the low-level embryo room, encountering people of all kinds, the old people who are comfortable playing chess under the big tree, the bargaining aunts in the vegetable market, or the high-heeled shoes in the bar. A woman who smokes, spits a smoke ring, forgets the past, or a man who is arrogant and drunk, and is incoherent on the road. Some people pass by, some people meet, some people will know each other because of the relationship, all the things that can be done during the trip, all the opportunities, I still can still do now, but the city I am in, once Let yourself be tired. Whether I meet more people or experience more things, this life can decide that my sorrows and sorrows will always be a few people around me. More people are just an episode in my life. But how will the idea change in the next moment, I don&#39;t know. As Luanke said, he once said that he would not fall in love and would not get married, and he was still married. I can only say a lot of words. It was revealed at the time that it was true and true, but the plan will never catch up with the changes. The unpredictable facts are too much to predict. Life is long, and in this case, you are loyal to your heart all the time. Although this is a way to treat the world as stupid and vulnerable, it is not against the heart and life can be full.",movie
675,"This is a solitary book written with the soul. People with shallow eyes cannot see. Yu Juan, a Fudan young teacher with a foreign experience and a doctorate, died of breast cancer. Only 32 years old. She used a straightforward tone to explain the inhuman torture that occurred in her own body. It is not an essay of a well-known writer. It is a diary of a patient who is suffering from cancer in a good life. However, the words left by people at the end of their lives are often the most embarrassing. Every piece of text is full of mourning for life and inner strength and gratitude. According to her description, the cancer cells spread, bone metastasis, the skeleton of the body was almost hollowed out, the bones of the whole body were sore, it could not move at all, it was difficult to stop the pain, but she endured the bone pain and shared her about the years before her death. The sentiment of life only benefits more people by vigilance. This is a passage in her manuscript: &quot;Cancer is a watershed in my life. Others seem to have destroyed my life. In fact, I am very surprised why it is half a year of cancer, except for the pain, I am so easy to be happy. I am not a sorghum, if Itâ€™s not this patient, itâ€™s naturally not going to be a world. This cancer has made me have to let go of everything. So, itâ€™s simple, itâ€™s really easy to be happy. Fame and fortune, no one is not hard, but no one can bring Go.&quot; She quoted Nietzsche&#39;s famous saying: Those who failed to kill me will make me stronger. The months of fighting the disease have not only ruined her fighting spirit, but also made it more indestructible. She is more than anyone who is proud to face death, she has also feared death, behind her are the potatoes waiting to be fed and the parents waiting for her to support, and the husband who accompanied her along the way, the original family and the initial exhibition The cause of eyebrows is undoubtedly a meteorite that can&#39;t breathe in the heart. Itâ€™s not a relief to let go. As a person who has never experienced too many twists and turns, any indifferent fame and fortune based on a certain economic foundation is just an empty talk. Aside from all the temptations of material desires, there are still many people who can do a thrilling thunder and face the lake. Itâ€™s just too expensive to exchange the pain of your own body for the enlightenment of life. After she survived many deaths, she realized that her life was too strong and victorious. She was too fond of worrying, too unwilling to do nothing, but she became ill until she became ill. In fact, she could not wait to go. The dreams realized or the tasks to be fulfilled can be put on hold for a while. In fact, everything in the world can be clouded. When I read this book, it was just that I was at the busiest stage.Every day, I was rushing around, and the company was buried in a pile of documents and documents. The progress of each order was carefully, fearing that there was a mistake. The pressure was so great that at night, someone was crying in the empty office. No one forced me or did. People give me pressure, I pressure myself, I push myself to the dead end again, all kinds of loneliness and helplessness come out again, the feeling is particularly empty, this year for a long time, I am I try to love myself in this way, because I stubbornly believe that I have not lived for my family in the past few years, but lived for a so-called love. Until then, my family no longer used my pillars. Until then, the feelings were finally broken, I was afraid of Repeat the same mistakes, while pretending to be chic, but it is difficult for yourself, thinking that you become a little self, you can stay away from harm. This feeling is very uncomfortable. However, when I thought it was a painful time, I saw that such a manuscript suddenly felt that my pain was negligible. How much does it cost to understand the meaning of living? If the person who said V is not a grass, it is a time when people will have a downturn. Just more often, thinking about what you have, even if you have nothing, still alive, is a kind of luck. Life is impermanent, eat well. Unpredictable things, wearing a warm and full sleep. I used to like the section of the simple frame &quot;April Split&quot;. During the day and night, I knew that I would continue to pay for my life.

I don&#39;t know when to start, whether it&#39;s Sangu and Liupo, or family and friends. When I chat, I can&#39;t do without the topic of finding a child to marry and have a family. Especially the group of three aunts and six women, single why not find the object, find the object Ask when to get married, get married and ask when to have a baby, give birth to a child and start to be more awkward than the children who climbed, who is more lovely. When we were studying, it was strictly forbidden for us to fall in love. When we graduated, we all counted on the world to drop a man with a house and a car to marry into a family. It is a great dream. My mother and I said, Mom, this is not a grocery shopping. I have to pick someone to pick me up. My mother immediately retorted, how can you pick someone, and someone will accept you. I said, you have to send the ducks to the shelves to arrange marriage for us. Do you manage happiness? What should you do if you want to leave? She said that everyone will get married sooner or later. I said that after I got married, I would only be able to bring my children at home, and even the work was estimated to have to give up. My mom said that all women in the world are the same. There is no more reason to explain the rebuttal to this group of elders who have had a significant generation gap with our generation. They stubbornly believe that as long as we find a suitable one in their marriageable age, there is a house, a stable job, a man who has a good character, and two people quickly set things down, they are loose. Tone, it&#39;s no different than writing a homework. But my mother still surrendered to me, she always couldn&#39;t control me, so she focused on the lifelong event of a sister who was two years younger than me. As long as I stayed at home for a long time, I heard this arrangement and I felt scared. The longer I am, the calmer I am to think about such a problem. From the beginning, I canâ€™t wait to start a new relationship. I finally get married and learn to be independent, but I still canâ€™t stand a personâ€™s loneliness and loneliness. I look forward to meeting it. A person, accompanied by this, and now, is completely calmed down. This may be a very short period of my life that can be selfish and self-sufficient. I have plenty of time and energy to pay attention to myself and improve myself. Why should we build a good life course on the social dogma of passing time? . Since the fate has not yet arrived, why do you want to hold your heart and face up and down? The dried bean curd said that there were only two possibilities for her to consider marriage, or to marry the otherâ€™s family, orThe other party has given her a certain degree of improvement, or that the person is very good to her, so that she appreciates and trusts, so even if she is willing to pay for it, she will be willing to pay for it, or else she will have to reduce her body and what to do. The requirements of the partner are changing all the time. I have set a lot of rules and regulations in the past. Until now, I found a truth. I have no intention of inserting a willow. I am the best person in the most casual time. The best time is like this. You The bar can&#39;t stop it. The more deliberately I wait to arrange, the more I will be in the end. More and more people around the world are married and have children. There are young couples who have a good life and a good day. They also have good wife and mother who are dedicated to the husband and wife. They have their happiness. We donâ€™t follow the big team, but we donâ€™t have to be derogatory. The life of older single girls is worried. Slightly and I said that getting married and having children is not her goal in life. When I say it, I have a look of embarrassment because she still has a series of dreams to complete. The idea is like hearing someone who is married and having a mess. Who is superficial? In my heart, I began to struggle to get divorced, without having to make a fuss. Pressure exists all the time, singles have the pressure to find objects, fall in love with the pressure of getting married, and having the pressure of child-rearing, just can&#39;t get rid of stress, you can learn to avoid stress, and No one is holding a knife on your neck, so you must live according to their way. After all, the day is over. Everyone needs a sense of security, but the true lasting sense of security is for oneself. Self-improvement is the premise of intimacy. Because of independence, I will never feel that the days are bleak, and I will not suffer from the loss of a single sentence. No matter who is single, married or divorced, knowing how to be kind to myself, independent people will always have strength. Let life bloom like a flower. My mom used to say that I often said that a girl can&#39;t be too strong and will scare off boys. But if a girl has a goal and has a strong dream, then such a boy is too weak. He wants to use the weakness of the girl to maintain his weak self-esteem. If you want to change for one person, unless you are willing to do so, if you want to please a person and change your mind blindly, you will slowly lose yourself. It is not as good as what you started, just like &quot;Spicy.&quot; Ma Zhengchuan, the classic line of Xia Bingbing: Ming is the kiwifruit produced in Sichuan, why should it be packed into New Zealand&#39;s kiwifruit. Well, I donâ€™t leave the rest.Things, others can be killed without price. What a man is so good can make me feel that it is worthwhile to give up the life that is free and free.",movie
677,"This kind of film, nothing else, just the two Hollywood movies Stallone and Schwarzenegger are just around the corner, just enough to satisfy your reason to go to the cinema to enjoy the film &quot;Golden Shelling&quot;. Hollywood&#39;s hard-action action movies are exactly what they support step by step, vaguely remembering the excitement and satisfaction that the action movie golden age brings to the audience. After experiencing the subversive era of action movies, especially gratifying and moving, these two tough guys have always adhered to the legend of tough guys and heroes, and continue to use their strong body, agility, and domineering acting on the big screen. The audience brings surprises! Perhaps they want to prove that they are not old, everything is right and can be used; perhaps they want to use their lives to present good works for fans. But no matter what, we can see that the figure they are waving can still return to the crazy state of the past, and there is also a nostalgic and tribute! If you don&#39;t see it yourself, a 1946 and a 1947 old guy can also pick up the muskets, hands and feet, and fight in the reinforced concrete cage with those young white-faced knives. With my skilled mathematics, I quickly came to the conclusion that the age of two people is 135 years old! This should be regarded as a senior man. In the evening, the bed is not necessarily able to play with the cart. The two of them are still flying and jailbreaking. I really can&#39;t imagine it. With the predecessor &quot;The Death Squad&quot; as a foreshadowing, Stallone has been proving that he is not old, and that an old man is still a singularity of the singer, and he can play in the &quot;Golden Shelling&quot;. A jailbreaking drama with high IQ. Not only can it be played, but also the mind is delicate, but also to crack the loopholes in each prison in order to strengthen security to prevent prisoners from escaping. On the basis of the tough guys in the past, there are a few more delicate and calm feet, and let these big men perform. It is a funny plot in itself. In fact, the script of &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is very interesting in itself. Like the American drama &quot;Prison Break&quot; which was once super-fired in China, Mike is in danger of saving the imprisoned brother, and Stallone is invited by the National Security Bureau. And deliberately imprisoned. The two purposes are different, but the behavior is the same. In &quot;Golden Shell&quot;, Stalloneâ€™s escape from prison to the end is like a magic. When it is revealed to the audience, it is the kind of pleasure and reveals the magic of Liu Qianchun. If the story has been in this cycle of repetition, it will be boring, so when Stallone is finally held in the &quot;living tomb&quot;, it is inevitableIt is necessary to cooperate with the good friend Schwarzenegger to complete the last jailbreak together. Here, Schwarzenegger, when the governor played the ticket, was a guest in the &quot;Death Squad&quot;, and later there was &quot;Backwaters&quot;, which made the fans nostalgic. In the &quot;Golden Shelling&quot;, it becomes a home of its own, not only can fight, but also very thoughtful. The encounter with Stallone in &quot;The Tomb of the Living Man&quot; was hard and hard, which aroused the adrenal glands of the audience. The follow-up was to help Stallone take objects, fight time, create opportunities... and finally set off on the plane. The scene of the gun is simply the body of the Terminator. At that moment, the fans of the whole audience are excited and unable to do it themselves. It seems that the era is back! Especially worth mentioning is that in front of the camera, Schwarzenegger&#39;s weird pose makes the audience applause thunder, the original tough guy is so popular. There is another detail in the film that shows us that the screenwriter of this movie is a special hate for Muslim countries: the big boss allows Muslims to pray at night, but in the end it is just to obtain the latitude and longitude of their position and betray the big boss, this is Infidelity; Second, when the Muslims died, they said that God blessed what was killed by the big boss. The implication is that God bless you a fart, not being killed by Lao Tzu. The Americans are quiet in the movie, and it is worth pondering. Overall, the story is complete, the cast is strong, there are muscles, there are scenes, when I see the latitude and longitude knowledge and the knowledge of the water flow in the northern and southern hemispheres, I am simply ashamed to die, if there is a chance to save myself, because my geography knowledge is not I must regret to die when I learn well. There are a lot of movies with love flags in the singles session, but it is rare that this Hollywood blockbuster will make the cold movie market warm again. If you are lonely, you are a bachelor, you want to date, this is the case. Because, it will make you more passionate!",movie

In the film, the female owner has a spare tire, and the male owner also has it, and it is still male. Even the spare tires have spare tires, they are still male, the flowers are rubbed, and the taste is heavy! BOSS is thick, and it is the relative of the man and the woman.

Part of Miyuki&#39;s work consistently excels at social and human concerns but the reasoning is relatively weak, and this is no exception. Although the design of the small inversion makes the composition of suspense and puzzles improve relative to &quot;Imitation Offense&quot;, too much unnecessary preparation has revealed the mystery prematurely. In addition, because the story is relatively simple, the Ministry used a lot of space descriptions for the police, which greatly reduced the compactness of the story.",movie
680,"To look at the drama of Wang Xinwei, a little closer, the public reputation is good, such as &quot;The Fire of Ambition&quot;, &quot;Peer with the enemy&quot;, &quot;Chong, the thin salary group&quot; &quot;truth&quot; is the credibility of the Wang Supervisor system. Therefore, the &quot;Giant Wheel&quot; has great expectations from the beginning. At the beginning of the drama, I think it is an inspirational drama that spans 30 years of age. It seems that I have seen the classic production of tvb twenty years ago, such as &quot;The Unsatisfactory&quot; &quot;Rogue Tycoon&quot; &quot;I Ben Shanliang and so on. But I was wrong. &quot;Giant Wheel&quot; is just a formal image. It is actually very rough, and there is still no low-level mistake in avoiding the tvb pipeline: the mobile phone in the jacket pocket after being born in prison, Jiang Yongâ€™s yellow hair is what to do. Are they going in and opening the body? After the kidnapping case occurred, the leopard brother rushed into the place where the four people were hiding. When the door was closed, the wall was shaken a lot, and the scene was really heart-rending. These low-level mistakes appeared in Wang Xinwei&#39;s drama, which made people disappointed. The scriptwriter of tvb telling stories is really too rare. The plot is handled with enthusiasm. The character of the character seems to be vivid, but it is unreasonable. Luo Xinji was burned, and at the same time that the business was sluggish, the branches opened one after another, and how the situation was recovered was completely confessed. Born 2 million sold franchise rights, Wen Ying said that she managed to spend 1 million to buy back, the difference of 1 million, she is the meat paid or the other party is actually open the Church. It is no wonder that after 90s, they began to write scriptwriters. Even after 80s and 70s, they were rushing in the process of growing up. In addition to the pressure of life, there are still many different experiences that can be used for script creation. Of course, in the process of watching the drama, many so-called collective memories will be brought up. For example, the return of Hong Kong and Macao, SARS and the financial crisis. At these special points in time, there will always be some special memories. In retrospect, everyone may be affected more or less. Born to find the original, but everyone is going back. Life is impermanent, the world is unpredictable, the deepest experience of the past decade.",movie
681,"The 89-year animation is so good, this is far from the Chinese animation. Suspense, true feelings and perfect anime effects make the film look exciting and beautiful. Car accidents, accidents, injuries, deaths, and bloodshed add a strange and sad atmosphere to the animation. Each action will have the remaining details, such as the car driving over the falling umbrella. In addition, the crystallized portrayal of tears, the interweaving of blood and lust, is so shocking. The piecemeal story tells the story of a secret story that hides secrets and misunderstandings. In the song of Nanjo Koji, the strings are smashed, more touching, and contemplative. The characters in the film are full and deep and thoughtful. Ozaki is born in love, ends in ritual, pays attention to spiritual level thinking, and makes every scene so beautiful.",movie
682,"&quot;Da Ming Rob&quot; is a film with warning significance. Through the director Wang Jing&#39;s hand, he will use the perspectives of Sun Chuanting and the travel doctor Wu Youke to deconstruct the inevitability of the building from the military and the people. Unrecoverable, it is true that the country will not be directly caused by the two, the tragedy of history is not written in one day, but Sun Chuanting, the commander of the crisis, also has many human weaknesses, although he is free from being killed, but in the army In the process of killing, it is chilling. Only Feng Bo, the wife of Sun Chuanting, who played Feng Bo, is a dignified and sage for the feudal dynasty that is about to turn pages. Sun Chuanting was played by Dai Liren. As a former general who was suddenly released from the death row and entrusted with heavy responsibility, the dramatic reversal of his life also affected the entire family, including his wife and son. Sun Chuanting, from the name, seems to have the meaning of &quot;passing the ancestors and continuing the imperial court&quot;, but the timely and historical mission is coming, the whole people are working hard, and still unable to return to heaven. Mrs. Feng, like the tens of thousands of women in ancient times, can only exist in the torrent of history in the way of â€œhaving no name and no nameâ€. If you go back and try to figure out &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot;, in fact, the true history of Daming&#39;s temperament will be exhausted. It is carried out from top to bottom through Chongzhen Emperor and Sun Chuanting, especially Sun Chuanting&#39;s drama is quite heavy, whether it is the court. , social affairs, local affairs, everything to worry about, only family affairs, so that he is completely worry-free, all thanks to his sage help?? Feng. If Chongzhen Emperor hangs on the occasion of the broken king of the king, the old banyan tree hanging from Jingshan is enough to prove that in the reign of Daming for a few years, it finally created a noble aristocratic family, then the self-destructive as the husband defeated. Feng Shi, also representing the heroic and loyalty of the famous and beautiful, is also memorable. Feng Bo, who plays Feng&#39;s, can be described as a classic &quot;competitive&quot; girl. Before the &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot;, she participated in the works of &quot;The Temple&quot;, &quot;I am a vegetative&quot; and &quot;Invisible Kill&quot;. And won various awards in the world. Being able to have today&#39;s achievements, as well as the director&#39;s deep recognition, is not a few awards can represent and explain, Feng Bo&#39;s pursuit of performing arts and the role of the three-pointed role in film and television works is the key to her as an outstanding actor. In the &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot;, there is very little space left for Feng Bo to play, but she did not perfunctory things. According to the director, Feng Bo used to play a professional scene with a glimpse of the scene. For a few months, challenge the eight-level track &quot;General Order&quot;, only for the most writtenReal performance. Feng Bo&#39;s performance is unobtrusive, very restrained, but full of character charm, which is not only due to her acting skills, but also her deep understanding of the characters. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, it was obviously not a heroine era of Mulan, Fan Lihua, Liang Hongyu, and Mu Guiying. However, the dignified female style under the traditional rituals of thousands of years has remained intact, so we watched it in the film. Feng&#39;s arrival is a typical example of everyone. It is not a matter of happiness, no sorrow, no love, no sorrow, no tolerance, even if you witness your husband&#39;s unprovoked brutality, you will still be able to stay away from guardianship. Model. The three most impressive dramas for the battle Taiwan appeared around this theme, and then the character Feng was portrayed to three-dimensional and full. The first is that Sun Chuanting was escorted by the Chongzhen Emperor, so that he was conscripted by the conscription, and Sun Chuanting returned home from the prison. When Feng was a plain-clothed man, the teacher taught him to swear, although the country would sway, if the family broke, but did not relax the child, It is a typical &quot;strict mother&quot; style. In such a difficult time and life, she silently bears everything, and silently educates the next generation to pass on everything, take two shots, and make a woman who has weathered the weather but never bowed to life. Presented. And as the servant&#39;s slogan &quot;The Lord is back&quot;, he can perceive the return of Sun Chuanting to the family. What a huge event, but Feng&#39;s calmness does not allow us to see the temperament of everyone who is not stunned. This is a fascinating look at this woman. The second is Sun Chuanting&#39;s expedition. Feng&#39;s wife, who is a wife, is fighting with her husband. She is dressed in red, sitting in the car, and her face is calm. Has she deeply interpreted the fate of the wife of the door? Or is it the mission of being a wife and a wife? No one knows, but in that one, as if all the plagues, the years of battle, have been pierced by the red of this red dress, the fleeting beauty, but left the most profound picture Imprints. Seeing this, the battle platform will think, what if you change an actor? Perhaps it is all kinds of expressions, eyes, small movements, for fear of missing every second of the performance opportunities in front of the camera, but such a performance is smart, really not what the director wants, so from this point of view Wang Jing chooses Feng Bo, that is the right thinking. In the film, there is Fengâ€™s bridge for the husbandâ€™s armor, which is popular for everyone. But the battle platform believes that Fengâ€™s being hijacked for a while is to focus the husbandâ€™s two different views on life on a deserter. Dripping. When Fengâ€™s journey was on the way, the waiter encountered a deserter. Fengâ€™s watched the otherâ€™s hunger and cold, and arranged drinking water, but did not expect grandchildren.When the court came to chase, the deserters saw the generals and learned that they could not escape. They had to reach out and grab the benefactor Fengâ€™s hostage to keep the road alive. Feng seemed to be aware of her husbandâ€™s cruel nature. Although she was taken hostage, However, his face was calm and calm, and he seemed to have done his best or was determined to be shot by his husband. He did not resist anything. Although the deserters later released the hand of Fengâ€™s hand under the coercion of Sun Chuanting, Sun Chuanting did not seem to take the promise of persuasion as a matter of fact, or he was killed by a rescuer and did not go to the lady who escaped from the tigerâ€™s head. Appease, and continue on the road, perhaps for him, the life and death of a person is only determined by the momentary thoughts, whether it is deserters or good wives. And Feng&#39;s move to her husband is quite calm, perhaps from the end of the thought, so that she has long accompanied her fate, all the way forward, no regrets. In fact, in the film &quot;Da Ming robbery&quot;, Feng Shi represents the feudal monarchy for thousands of years. Although the dynasty has changed many times, feudal thought has always existed, just like the film to the Ming Emperor. From the middle to the general, down to the people, the corpse is everywhere, and the community has changed to a new day, but the feudal system that ruled China for thousands of years has not changed fundamentally. Even the Qing Dynasty, which originated from the Manchu, still follows. What Fengâ€™s embodiment is is the power that seems to be powerless and intangible, but determines everything. This is the place where Sunâ€™s is in Da Ming.",movie
683,"&quot;Dog Stick&quot; is a huge piece of the domestic TV series broadcasted this year. It has 70 sets of space and no one can compete. Although the story begins with the grievances of the two brothers and sisters of Rehe Daijia, the time span is large and the incident span is large. It is not just the mentoring and grievances of cleaning up the portal, but the people of the Rehe together, unable to help themselves. Into the torrent of the war against aggression, a blood legend. &quot;Tiger Dog&quot; is currently broadcasted more than half in Beijing Satellite TV and Anhui Satellite TV. It has been well received and the ratings have been repeated. It is not unreasonable. From the performance point of view, Xunzi and other stars have deep stage performance skills, so the drama&#39;s dramatic performance style is obvious. Both the character position and the character dialogue are all stable and powerful. Strong. Director Guo Jingyu has directed &quot;Tie Lihua&quot; and &quot;Red Lady&quot; before, and is a very telling director. However, most of the past works mainly show female characters. This time, &quot;transfer&quot; male characters, Still has the moving effect of a bowel knot, such a plot, the most likely to be concerned. As everyone knows, although the anti-Japanese war dramas are overwhelming, the anti-Japanese war theme is still the gold-plated signboard for viewing and selling. Only the quality is excellent, it will be popular. Nowadays, the audience has gone to the battlefield. In the age of peace, how many opportunities can you feel the rain? Through the film and television drama works to fill the gap to dream. &quot;Dog Stick&quot; is a legend. In general, it is the anti-Japanese legend, which is the largest proportion of the anti-Japanese drama. Since it is a legend, it will surpass the reality to a certain extent. The &quot;dog stick&quot; can be described as a legend of the Rehe. The distance is a reflection of the legend of the entire Chinese nation. Dai and the two represent the two shares on the land of China. Forces, in the wheel of history, cooperation, division, reconciliation, noisy... Whether it is abandoning the suspicion, or the resurgence of the storm, or even the inconsistency, is based on historical adaptations, if there are good things to obtain evidence, you may find Source. The most dazzling star in &quot;The Dog Stick&quot; is the &quot;dog stick&quot; that is not well-behaved, curved, and bumpy. The original words in the play are well said: &quot;Play dog â€‹â€‹sticks, specialize in mad dogs, evil dogs, traitor dogs, aggression dogs! pole help, protect the family, defend the country, Xingbang!&quot; Of course, Dai Tianli had to hit the dog stick accidentally, so After being framed by the family and rescued by the gangs, the second half of the sentence was not mentioned, but this did not prevent him from becoming a gang helper. Regarding the dog stick, it is not the first of the poles. I donâ€™t see Jin Yong and so on.In the rivers and lakes of their respective works, the non-mainstream gang of &quot;gang&quot; will not be missed. This is the largest trade union organization in the country and the first family-owned enterprise in China to implement modern enterprise management. Its business scope covers a wide range. In addition to the work footprints throughout the country, and with the &quot;Dragons 18 palms&quot; and &quot;dogs stick method&quot; mixed with martial arts, became the world&#39;s largest gang. Although according to the legend of the rivers and lakes, carrying a few bags, is the identity and status symbol in the gang, but on behalf of the gang to help the identity of the lord, there is only one sacred object, that is, playing dog sticks. The legendary lord is holding a dog stick, there is a color of Wujin, and there is also a green color, mostly bamboo rafts, and there are still some differences in the play of &quot;playing dog sticks&quot;. But the stick in the drama is obviously in the power, to surpass the ancestors, not only to hit a line, but also to sweep a large piece, the length is appropriate, the attack and attack are suitable, the most powerful is the devil who faces the steel gun bayonet It is also not soft, and with a wave of hands, the enemy has fallen to the ground, and its fighting strength has surpassed a strengthening company. It can be seen that Dai Tianli&#39;s hand-held &quot;dog stick&quot; has already surpassed the scope of woodware ironware, but it is in line with the weapon &quot;burning fire stick&quot; used by Zhang Xiaofan in &quot;Zhu Xian&quot;. It is well known that this fire stick is made of black short stick. The soul and the blood-stained beads are combined, and the power is superior. With its power, it can be worthy of the attacking index of killing the enemy. In fact, the &quot;playing a dog stick&quot; in the play is nothing more than a materialized spiritual pillar. You can say that it stands for strength. It can also be said to represent bravery. It can even represent recklessness, impulsiveness, and unwillingness... What is Dai Tianli? From being a single person, becoming a gang of masters, becoming a hero of the party, not only the enemy of the enemy, but also the aggressor, relying on nothing but the arrogance of the body, it can be said that Dai Tianli holds the truth and the god of the righteousness, but carries In fact, it is the sons and daughters of the Chinese who rely on the justice of the world, the &quot;dog stick&quot; that is not surprising but sturdy, and in the view of the battle Taiwan, it is the backbone of the Chinese nation, the stick is not lost, the soul is there, People win, the country is not dead! Can&#39;t easily lose it~~~~",movie
684,"Itâ€™s no wonder that itâ€™s blameless. In the movie market in Europe and America, the supernatural images of vampires, wolves, and Frankenstein are frequent visitors on the screen. When they appear on the scene, they are mostly light and shadow hackers, but as time goes by, these &quot;é­‘é­…é­é­‰&quot; has long since lost the madness of the past, more and more revealing the inner tenderness and &quot;humanity&quot; side. The core character of &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is a pair of cute vampire fathers and daughters. His father is the famous &quot;Vampire ancestor&quot; Count Dracula. In order to protect his daughter Mephis from human harm, he specially built a building. &quot;Elves Hostel&quot;, all the monsters are welcome here, just to stay away from humanity. However, the arrival of a young boy Jonathan quickly broke the calm in the Elf Hostel. If Jonathanâ€™s intrusion into the monster world is only a â€œtechnical accidentâ€; then the secret between him and Mephis is virtue. Gula will want to get rid of it and then have a big heartache. As the most classic vampire image in the history of human cinema, Count Dracula has been consumed by the film industry for a long time. Even the image of a vampire has become a film and television element that the audience is keen on. â€œThe Twilight Cityâ€ and â€œTrue Bloodâ€ &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; and &quot;The First Generation Vampires&quot; and other film and television dramas have appeared together. The vampires are no longer the horror monsters that suck blood and take life, but are generally sentimental and affectionate. &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; did not directly extend the theme of love in the Count of Dracula (this theme has been taken very accurately by &quot;Freakish Four Hundred Years&quot;), but turned him into an anxious single father, In order to suppress the beginning of the adolescent daughter&#39;s initial affair, he was busy. Jonathan is not a tall man handsome? His style in this 3D cartoon is even somewhat ugly, but Mephis is just looking at him, &quot;Zing fell in love with him&quot;, and this is also normal for young men and women. Caused by the situation. On the other hand, domestic cartoons or youth idols and TV dramas, which are deeply influenced by Japanese and Korean cultures, mention that the love of boys and girls is all kinds of beautiful men and handsome guys, either to show off the riches, or to look after the appearance, the childish, The ordinary but true feelings of the young love are rarely seen. In this sense, the concept of love in &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is worthy of publicity. Since &quot;Shrek&quot; subverted the fairy tale, &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; once again reversed the tension between humans and monsters in the legendary story?? Human beings become the &quot;monsters&quot; that kill love and cruelly kill, the monsters are anti-It turned into a pollution-free â€œgood citizenâ€ (the only exception is the French-speaking monster cook). Dracula killed Mephis&#39; love to protect her, but when he finally realized that his daughter&#39;s growth was inevitable, he eventually fulfilled the fate between Jonathan and Memphis. With the launch of film and television dramas such as &quot;The Forest Cabin&quot; and &quot;American Horror Story: Psychiatric Hospital&quot;, the &quot;big mess&quot; method of melting all kinds of horror images has gradually become popular. The Elf Hostel is no exception. Itâ€™s just that the first two are still the old ways of â€œfearing fearâ€, and â€œThe Elf Hostelâ€ has completely turned into a journey of â€œMeng Xinâ€ filled with love. Of course, what is more important is the opening of supernatural themes. In a relaxed and relatively free creative environment, vampires, wolves, and Frankenstein are just some elements of artistic expression. It is not an untouchable â€œflooding beastâ€; in addition, to preserve and give the audience a childlike heart, the supernatural story is actually an excellent carrier? â€œThe Elf Hostelâ€ has set an example for us in both aspects.

685,"I haven&#39;t read the work of Teacher Yu Qiuyu for a long time. Last time I went back to high school. At that time, our lovely male class teacher lost to the opponent because of the class football team. After the class meeting, I carefully read the Taoist Tower. The more I read, the more excited I was, until I was in tears. After so many years, I still remember it. Yu Qiuyu of that era is full of the worries of the homeland in my opinion. Although the surface is a short story, it is a criticism of the insensitivity of the people and the nation. It is unforgettable to give people a sense of vibrancy. Thanks to the shock of this article, I chose this book without hesitation, and I also have envy for Chinese classical culture, and the unique beauty of China chosen in this book: calligraphy, Kunqu Pu&#39;er tea, I also yearn for it. Pu&#39;er tea is a kind of tea that I often drink and is also my favorite. Although there are many people who like to drink Pu&#39;er, I have never talked to anyone about Pu&#39;er tea. Kunqu Opera is a relatively small-scale drama. In the past, he only watched the movie &quot;The Dream of the Garden&quot; and heard about Bai Xianyong&#39;s promotion of Kunqu. Calligraphy was practiced when we were young. I still remember the inability to hand over a few calligraphy characters every day. Later, I finally found a soft-headed pen that can easily write a few large brush-filled numbers. Maybe then Too small to understand the beauty of calligraphy. Now that I see this book, I have a heartfelt joy. If you like Chinese culture, if you like classical literature and like beautiful things, you can read this book. After reading this book, I learned that Pu&#39;er as a kind of tea has such a wonderful history, what is &quot;grade tea&quot;, what is &quot;printed tea&quot;, and what is the &quot;seven tea&quot; we often hear about. Understand the production method of Pu&#39;er tea, the ranking of Pu&#39;er tea, and the teacher Yu Qiuyu in the book have made a detailed and interesting explanation for us. It turns out that the taste of Pu&#39;er tea can have so many vivid descriptions. The original Pu&#39;er tea contains time to be refined. The precipitation is the taste of the years. I am also surprised that perhaps the Pu&#39;er that I have tasted before is enough to be amazing, but perhaps it is not really good Pu&#39;er tea. I must fight for the true taste of Pu&#39;er tea in the future. I saw the part of Kunqu Opera, and I felt that it was a singer. Although I knew Yuanqu and felt that the words and songs of Yuanqu were full of fragrance, I never carefully reviewed the relationship between Yuanqu and Kunqu, and I have never understood many artists. With so much effort and improvement, I have never heard of Kunquâ€™s Kunming word originally referring to Kunshan. I have never heard of Wengâ€™s and Zhang Yetangâ€™s Weng.å©¿ä½³è¯, after my own thoughts and verifications, I realized that the original &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; was originally heard by Kunqu! ! ! ! ! ! ! It turns out that Kunqu is the ancestor of all forms of drama. If Mr. Bai Xianyong&#39;s efforts made me have a basic understanding of Kunqu, then the detailed explanation of this book will give me more understanding and more love for Kunqu. Finally, I talked about calligraphy because there is no more love for calligraphy. But after reading this part of calligraphy history, I finally got some familiar understanding of calligraphy. The names of historical figures who used to have one tablet, I finally got stereoscopically, let me know how great those names are. They finally stood up from the history books and formed a vein about calligraphy! After leading me to appreciate the many calligraphy inscriptions, I suddenly felt that it was a soft one. A brush, a shallow ink, can write ever-changing emotions and change the ancient and modern. The spatter between the thick and thin strokes is not only the talent of the Chinese nation, but also the life of each calligraphy master. After watching it, people are awe-inspiring. After reading this book, I think of the lines in a movie I like very much: &quot;medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble ideals, but poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are the reasons for our survival. These beautiful things that existed in China for hundreds of years or even thousands of years have condensed the wisdom and philosophy of China for five thousand years, and deserve our most understanding, respect and love.",movie

Shanghai, the dragons and the tigers, the times alternate, the forces of all sides fight against each other, gangs, citizens, students, workers, wealthy businessmen, intellectuals, together in the national crisis, a unique chaotic epic. Directed by Tan Youye and Hong Danqiang, Xing Jiadong, Han Wenwen, Gao Hu and other acting stars played &quot;The Ten Miles of the Winds&quot;, which is another legendary drama that focuses on the beach. From Zhang Xun&#39;s restoration to the 1920s, Japan began to whale. In China, a small person in history is immersed in the torrent of the times, from Tianjin to Shanghai, from the police to the gang to the hero, and Xing Jiadongâ€™s love and hate is closely intertwined with the fate of the country. A magnificent ten-mile ocean field. Compared with the previous works on the beach theme, &quot;The Ten Miles of the Wind&quot; has several distinctive features that attract audiences and generate strong repercussions. The perspective of the one is more unique, and the time and space scale is relatively open, not simple. The scope was locked in Shanghai, and the story was launched from Tianjin. From the inside to the table, the vortex of the battle on the beach gradually became more and more beautiful. From the event of Zhang Xunâ€™s restoration, the story of Zhang Xunâ€™s will be described by Zhang Xunyi. The escort disk Long Yuyu entered Beijing, and was robbed by the revolutionary party in Tianjin. On the way, the patrol house dispatched the elite of the capture industry, Chen Changyou, to conduct a tracing. In the process of multi-party competition for the jade, Lu Changyou and the female revolutionary party Xia Yuxin gradually wiped out. Love fire, but was designed by Zhu Hongsheng, the head of the party, and Xia Xinxin unfortunately sacrificed. In order to avenge his lover, Lu Chang went to the beach and vowed to die with the party.

Compared with the general gangs, they are more systematic in their mastery of deception, except for &quot;cheat&quot;. A variety of rumors of hand-poisoned industry-unclear industry secrets, there are very vivid manifestations in the play. And the struggle in the playFighting has become more interesting because of the addition of scams. Lu Chang is not an ordinary revolutionary or ambitious. In order to achieve the goal of revenge, he changed his name to Lu Xingtian on the beach, and he turned to the partyâ€™s veteran to defraud and stage. A sparkling scam. Thirdly, &quot;The Ten Miles of the Storm&quot; has a strong idol temperament. In the process of showing the protagonist Lu Chang from the patrol to the gang and then to the revolutionary hero, it is full of romanticism, scene props fresh and chic, action drama, gun battle The dramas are designed with exuberant brilliance and without losing the gorgeous style of Shanghai. The protagonist is a lingering love story on the revolutionary road. The bloody rivers and lakes fight, the two heroes fight against each other, and they are lightly loaded.

692,"Watching movies at 12 o&#39;clock in the morning is not something that ordinary people can do. But on the first day of the show, I rushed to the cinema before 10 o&#39;clock at noon. I think that when I go out at 10 o&#39;clock last weekend, I am afraid that I will only have a physical examination. done. I have seen too many concerts, and I have no interest in the story of grandfather and guitar. Yes, the purpose of the concert movie is to see them in the first row. For fans, the biggest attraction/smile in the movie is The sentence &quot;Grandpa, can you play the guitar?&quot; The first part is the same as the concert. In the case of dim lighting, the lens is erratic, making people feel a bit stuffy and have the urge to sleep. Originally, it was not a song with a high degree of singing. If you havenâ€™t seen their concerts, there is really an impulse to leave. Fortunately, I donâ€™t belong to this rank. The first thing that touched me in the movie was the good night of Ashin, because it was Shanghai on October 7th, it was my first Mayday concert. After I fell in love with them, after missing the nest, I think, anyway, I have to go to the scene. Following the camera, we walked through the Bird&#39;s Nest, Shanghai, Kaohsiung, Hong Kong, and naturally remembered the little things of each event. The significance of each trip is not only the three hours of concerts, but also the preparations before the trip, the unknown friends who know each other, the impression of the city, which constitutes the unforgettable memories of these years. The subtitles of the starry sky began to give laughter, the fate stole the apple, and then Marthaâ€™s climax face and stone calm enjoyment, also used super slow motion, monster guitar (but I want to see his face) and thin I have to be a lead singer like a piece of paper. How do you think about it? The song row is a bit strange, hug and then pick up the second life? T121? Contentment (some games have not sung swearing, but this is indeed every song must be sung)? Suddenly I think you are actually the last one? (The deaf person counts it.) And where is the most talked about the concert? Not even a member of the group introduced. It is undeniable that even if I am a brain powder, I can hardly say that this film is good. Before that philosophical transition, I always had the feeling of not entering the state. The song used is red? JUMP screen + do not know which screen, anyway, in May this year, there should be no such song, and the picture of the infield balloon is definitely the Hong Kong field in 2013. Itâ€™s not that bad, but many times, what we want to hear is more of the simplest songs, those that make the nest blueThe investment in the collective discoloration of the light sticks and the hard editing of the songs can really be saved. These two years of tour have gone too far, and my friends have become accustomed to listening to me saying that my idol has created a feat and the endless concert. At the beginning of 2013, when I said that I was going to see Noahâ€™s Ark, their first reaction was that the end of the world was not over yet. The group was short of money, a tour would take two years, and even the concert could Make a movie. I have to explain silently that they have to pay six cents to raise their younger siblings, earning hard money, and Noah&#39;s Ark will be open to 2014, so I will continue to pay attention. Others don&#39;t understand my madness and happiness, but for the five fans, these are really not important. Just like I know that the doll and SR are a bottomless hole for burning money, I will continue to contribute as always, only because it is Mayday. The quality of the film has many criteria for judging. As a viewer sitting in the cinema, the film has aroused the audience&#39;s resonance and emotion. Although this is only for a special group of people, they did. This movie is when the big ship is parked, so that we can have the opportunity to revisit this crazy time with the little friends, the best commemoration of this tour. The lead singer said that he hopes that the song he wrote can accompany us when no one sees you. You really did it. At the end of the movie, itâ€™s the sentence that you didnâ€™t leave May Day and they debuted in Japan. Noahâ€™s Ark is still going on. Every day in the European Tour + Japan and South Koreaâ€™s life, every point in the pocket is really hard to leave.",movie
693,"The first time I watched this film, I was still a high school girl with a thin mind and awkward thinking. The unique interpretation of the film and the sharp narration of the words bring a sense of sobriety and loneliness to the girl who is ignorant and confused. At the beginning of the 20th, during the university period, it was once again re-examined. The loneliness that the film has laid down in the bottom of my heart is even more infinitely spread like ink. Today, 25, there is a boyfriend who loves himself and happens to love himself. The relationship develops stably and beautifully. However, at the age of 25, it seems to belong to an unsettled, impetuous age, still drifting in fantasy and reality. Tonight, like God&#39;s arrangement, the whimsy of turning on the computer to find the last episode of this film, just look at the last episode, just want to see the last episode, inexplicable. I heard that the &quot;Karma&quot; came along with Mauna&#39;s letter, and it lingered on my ears, making me a pilgrimage-like piety. Mao Naâ€™s description of Zhou Haixiao inspired me to think about the one around me in the same warm mood, and suddenly realized it!

694,"Probably I belong to a group of people who are easily implied by the psychological. I didnâ€™t use this book as a casual reading, but I read it over and over again in a positive color. I used the very worrying feeling and the imagination of ten times to make the bookâ€™s â€œguidanceâ€ serious. Thinking about it, it seems that the Sora virus will break out next month. Let&#39;s take the time to learn the survival skills. It won&#39;t be killed too early or won&#39;t have bones left. When I saw it suddenly realized (and especially the connection between the book and the authorâ€™s &quot;Zombie World War&quot; novel), the more problems I lived in the future, the years have not been out of the city, I donâ€™t know the wilderness. For the city slaves who are living skills, the author describes the safest way to survive. Choose a wild place to hide, how far to hide, away from the city, away from any densely populated areas, plains, forests, mountains, hills, Coasts, desert islands, ice fields, deserts, all have their own advantages and disadvantages. The most important thing is that there are no other people, there are also non-polluting water sources, and a steady stream of energy supplies. Later I figured out that there are many available in the authors. The safest place to escape is the offshore drilling platform. The benefits are: 1. It can be completely isolated from the land, and there is a perfect living and working space above the waterline. Zombies can&#39;t climb up. 2. On the supply side, people usually pass The vessel transports a large amount of materials, including living and medical supplies, to the platform at one time, and can maintain all staff for six months. For fresh water, oil and natural gas extraction devices ensure a steady stream of energy; it sounds like a vacation to an offshore drilling platform, but the author has listed a lot of innocent disasters: 1. The corrosive effect of salty air is the system is deteriorating. If the asylum-seekers don&#39;t operate the rig system, everything is white. If you want to see the author, you really want to get the author out of a fat meal. The book is written by you. This world view and cosmology are your structure. The rules of the game are yours. I see that the author&#39;s writing of this book and other basic zombie works implies a &quot;zombie-based&quot; thinking. The human language uses sentences to express the meaning of the words. &quot;Crisp like a dog.&quot; Basically, there is no way to live. A book looks so uncomfortable, sleeping at night because of the problem of how much volume of toilet paper to be tossed and turned; on the road to see the gardener&#39;s iron shovel used to turn over and big and strong, I thought this is a weapon to prevent the zombie head. And then watched for a long time. In order to return to reality, as a reader, you cannot be passive in front of the author and his text.Sitting and waiting, what did Abrams say? Or is it Bakhtin or Kristeva? In short, the meaning is &quot;readers, you will be bold to participate in it&quot;, in other words, everyone can vomit. The person becomes a zombie because the heartbeat of the Solanum virus is stopped, and the infected body is confirmed to be &quot;dead&quot;... Although the brain survives but is dormant, the virus turns it into a brand new tissue organ. Its most important feature is that it is completely independent of oxygen... This undead brain can re-apply physical ability through a highly independent and complex function of the human body: the body is the same as the human body, the only difference is that the body is Infected brain control, unless humans have the ability to fly around, or zombies will never... it can effectively use these unconventional combinations, or extend their durability to the point where mortal can&#39;t reach: even those who don&#39;t have The zombies of the eyes can also accurately capture the prey hearing: super strong, not only can detect the sound, but also can determine the direction of the sense of smell: keen, can accurately distinguish the taste of the living prey in any situation: able to distinguish between human and Animal blood, and prefer the former touch: all nerve receptors on the body surface It is dead, even if the body is seriously damaged, it will not stop attacking until it finally rots: the average &quot;life cycle&quot; is about three to five years... almost all microorganisms related to the decomposition of ordinary human corpses will instinctively avoid The cells that are infected by the virus, therefore, enable the zombies to effectively protect their forces: the power that zombies can release is no different from humans. The strength of the body muscles will remain after their death. Adrenaline has no effect on the zombies, making the zombies unable to release powerful explosive power like humans. But they have the ability that humans can&#39;t match, that is, excellent endurance and excellent endurance. If so, it solves the huge scientific and technological problems in human history, especially since the industrial revolution. It can provide without energy transfer. Inexhaustible power, nuclear energy, hydropower, wind power, solar energy will be eclipsed in the face of everlasting zombies, can imagine a new energy car, a driving tool driven by one or several zombies, the rear engine is similar The prototype container of the hamster cage is replaced. As soon as the human enters the car, the zombie begins to move in the hamster cage, and then the mechanical energy can be transformed into the driving force of the car. However, the superiorIs the endurance really lasting? Any machine will wear out after running for a period of time. As a zombie with human body and physical characteristics, it is not the body of King Kong. It repeats an action for a long time, such as walking, running, hitting, falling, climbing, stretching, bending. Waist, if it is a human being, it has long been reported to be injured. If it is a zombie, there will be a situation where the limbs break and then fall off, and then you can only move forward. If the frictional resistance of the ground is very large, such as in rubble, sand, Advancing on the slope, the wear of the trunk is also amazing. Therefore, it is optimistic to imagine that the zombie army that can persist until later human encounters is likely to be the corpse of the lack of arms and legs and half-buried loess and head toward the human teeth. Therefore, if the zombies enter the energy field, the maintenance problem is also After all, excellent persistence is an advantage. If it can be used well, nature is a blessing for the benefit of mankind. There is a profession that needs to be further developed, that is, dentists, or anyone with knowledge of stomatology. The reason is also very simple. It is as if the male who served in the emperor to go to the emperor was forced to go to the situation and was worried about it. The zombies who serve the people must also be managed in a unified manner. The most important thing is to pull out the teeth and pull them clean. If you have a condition, you can also install a soft denture (if you have such a thing), or if you are worried about safety, you can configure the sealing device for the zombie. It can be a mask, a mask, a helmet, according to local customs and people&#39;s aesthetics. Itâ€™s fun to arrange it yourself. Therefore, dentists are a very important profession. In addition, zombies can also make great strides in the service industry. For example, they become very good masseurs, and there will never be an occupational disease of human masseurs. If properly guided, zombies can also join the catering industry, such as simple dough, mixing and other machinery. Work, if someone opens a restaurant, you can write the &quot;Zombie Shrimp&quot;, a long-lost dish on the menu.",movie

697,"In the past few years, I have seen the most movies with love as the main line, and the most written words about love. Probably because love is a game that does not win or lose. People are always lost in love, and they are constantly getting. Only those who dare to try, keep their hearts and grow up will be so sweet. Therefore, as a person, you should grow up in love. The first lesson was written by Isabel. She told us that as a woman, we must know how to be the master of life. She represents those who are proactive and even optimistic. In the face of the family curse, she did not passively wait, but took the initiative to attack. In the face of the entangled dilemma, her little cleverness is enough to cause headaches? Yes, if that person does not love you, she is so worried, and this kind of jealousy is not a short-term pain relief. When she finally found her true love, she no longer hesitated, turned and turned clean. Yes, a woman who is too smart may not be too happy, but in love, as a kind woman, there should be enough wisdom to not hurt or harm others. The second lesson is naturally John. This is a bit silly, a bit cute, the two words are summed up as &quot;stupid Meng&quot; men, different from the general high-fashionable male actor, he is completely in the heart of the beauty. He can be unconditional to a person, can forget all kinds of troubles in life, enjoy the beauty of the world with a simple heart, and can turn around indecisively after understanding the truth. Therefore, people like him deserve to have beautiful love and a happy life. The third lesson is about Isabelâ€™s boyfriend who has been in love for ten years. He has clear goals and rigorous planning for his life, and he is meticulous in his work. If you have a constellation enthusiast, you will generally be classified as Virgo. Just keep working hard and he should be a successful person. But in love, I lost seriously. Can&#39;t be too careless, can&#39;t be fixed, can&#39;t be too rigid, otherwise, it has to be self-sufficient. However, he finally let go, isn&#39;t it? It was the wedding night of Meg Ryan in Seattle&#39;s sleepless night. Whether they are good enough, but they leave the last love to the heroine, that is to let go, give them the life they want. From this point of view, they also have the character of a gentleman. Finally, if you want to say a question, is it true love for long live, if you encounter more love, you must give up the previous appointment. Before you get married, you still choose freedom. Although you donâ€™t advocate it, itâ€™s not against you.Correct. After all, what you are looking for is a lifelong partner. After all, love is the best. But after getting married, looking for true love is, in my personal case, unacceptable. If there is no responsibility, what is the point of marriage? In short, blessing a lover will eventually become a genus, blessing the happy life of the prince and the princess.",movie
698,"&quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is like a ghost animated version of &quot;To meet the father-in-law&quot;. The most famous Dracula count in the history of the vampire disturbs the love between her daughter and the son-in-law, while the strangers, werewolves, vampires, mummies and other ghosts gather. One, often brewing absurd humor and ridicule, let people have a good time. This kind of PG-level family fun animation can not only amused children, but also makes adults laugh and still tells the story of â€œbreaking stubbornness and accepting new things from outsideâ€. I am afraid that this is the original intention of the editors. The film is extremely interesting, and the ghosts who are hiding in the world are not afraid to see humans. A misunderstood, silk youth, did not intend to break into their world, but caught up with Draculaâ€™s daughterâ€™s birthday party. This love for young men and women, yin and yang, can make Dracula annoyed. How can humans fall in love with vampires? Can Dad not worry? In order to make her daughter afraid of human beings, he pretended to set up a scam in the village to scare his niece. Then, Dad used both the trick and the trick, how to get rid of the human kid, but Hollywood popcorn is free to marry, you can guess the young men and women together, but the process of &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; is quite interesting of. In the design of the silk youth, the Sony team learned the essence of the predecessor &quot;Christmas Arthur&quot;: the young man is tall and thin, handsome and handsome, modern and trendy, and very clever and likable. Dracula wants to be like an uncle, and he always has a long face and a parent&#39;s face. He still turns into a small bat and shows that &quot;the gods are making the world.&quot; All the ghosts came to celebrate the birthday, and the monsters that appeared on the scene were all kinds of cute and funny. It was obviously designed and designed to make people feel the imagination of the Hollywood team. The monsters are super huge, there are dragging their mouths, and the image is bizarre, scared. The young faces of the silk are discolored, so that everyone laughs. The Silk Youth and the Old Man PK are also a highlight, especially when they are sitting on the table and chasing a paragraph, not only returning to the funny era of &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;, but also showing the gorgeous scene of the European Castle. The 3D stereo effect is also dazzling. Probably because &quot;Twilight City&quot; is popular all over the world, &quot;Christmas Arthur&quot; nominated the Golden Globe Award for Best Animation, so that Sony Animation saw the market prospects, so I worked hard to create this &quot;Elves Hostel&quot;, and in the details I have done enough. The Sony animation team is not as touching as Pixar, and there is no such thing as a subversion of DreamWorks, but the level of entertainment and exquisiteness is unique in Hollywood. Although we clearly see that &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; has &quot;The night of Christmas Eve, &quot;Adams&quot; and other classic ghost comedies, but Dracula&#39;s selling funny, still let everyone shine. Not only did he risk his daylight, he became a bat to catch up with the plane, saved his son-in-law, and took the microphone to sing rock music at the end, making everyone full of surprises. For the sake of my daughter&#39;s happiness, I can make mistakes and change my life, and risk my life. Where can I find such a dad? However, &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; does not have the touching color of &quot;Crazy Primitives&quot; and &quot;Invincible Destruction King&quot;. The Count of Dracula has been killed by human beings, and there are family and love, all written down to the point, 3D technology There is no breakthrough in the subversive nature of the plot. However, the youth &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot; were black out, and the spirit of this spoof is quite good. Dracula, Frank, transparent people, cockroaches and other monsters come out to sell cute and funny, but also super amused. In addition, the Sony animation team insisted on breaking the theme of breaking the stubborn closure, although it is very commonplace, it still makes me praise. It is said that Hollywood animation leads the world. From the various details of &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;, they will always break the four old mistakes. This is where the mainland animators need to learn.",movie
699,"There are many movies about the Vietnam War, and there are many good works. So letâ€™s talk about the reason for choosing this movie: The field battle film was created in the context of the movie that sings the heroes of war heroes, and its director Oliver Stone is one. The veteran who participated in the Vietnam War personally adapted and filmed the film with his own personal experience, and this film is also the first and most outstanding of his Vietnam War trilogy. This film, which seems to be technically inferior and slightly exaggerated, has inspired and influenced a large number of films including the rescue of Ryan and Black Hawk. It is said that war is no longer so important. What is important is people. Human relations, the relationship between people and war. Therefore, if we want to see humanity from the war, I think this film is very suitable. The Vietnam War (1959? 1975), referred to as the Vietnam War, was a war between South Vietnam and the United States against the communist North Vietnam and the &quot;Vietnamese Southern National Liberation Front&quot; (also known as the Viet Cong). It can be said that it is the pain in the hearts of Americans. It lasts for a long time, and the tragic situation of the war revolves around the Americans like a nightmare, which greatly weakens the American arrogance and subverts their views on war. In the late war, the United States broke out. Many anti-war movements, this war also hit the US economy. The film&#39;s protagonist, Taylor, is a college student who was enlisted in an infantry force with the bloody dropout of &quot;combat for the country&quot; like most Americans at the time. However, his full blood was quickly ruined by the cruel reality. He was shocked by the distortion of human nature in the war. He doubted the justice of this war; but he finally found his own understanding of this war. : What you are fighting against in the war is not the enemy, it is yourself. And &quot;self&quot; we can understand that it is our own heart, and it is the humanity exposed by the irresistible external force of war. At the beginning of the film, a US soldier described Vietnam as hell. The hardships of Vietnamâ€™s combat environment have been seen in many Vietnam War movies. The film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; has also ridiculed the jungle environment in Vietnam, but for those soldiers. Is it because Vietnam is just like hell because of the environment? I don&#39;t think so, others are hell. In such an environment, humanity is distorted, the dark side is exposed, people begin to kill innocents, intrigues and even kill each other. The so-called symbol of justice in human nature has not come to the end in this war, or even death. It is quite tragic. The film&#39;s protagonist, Taylor, appears more in a big way as a bystander and thinking.In the film: Taylor as a recruit is undoubtedly green and idealistic. Although he is a college student, he does not know the true meaning of this war like other soldiers from the bottom of society. He thinks he is a party to justice and is helping the people in the local suffering. The maturity of Taylor&#39;s role is actually mature with his maturity of war on human nature. Two of them play a very important role, one is Elias and the other is Barnes. (Barnes). I understand these two roles as the opposite of humanity: Elias symbolizes the sense of justice in the war to maintain conscience and maintain the moral bottom line; Barnes symbolizes the instinct of a person facing death. A killing instinct that is desperate for survival. It has been said that if you die, it is best to be in the first few weeks because you will not suffer too much pain. Taylor&#39;s spirit is dying under the torment of war. He needs a spiritual pillar, but he does not know what can support him to live. Is the instinct for survival? Then he will become as numb as Barnes; is the idea that justice will overcome evil? But Ulysses died under Barnes. At the end of the film, a black comrade-in-arm of Taylor inspired him. Taylor asked Kim: &quot;You have been entangled in the mistakes that can&#39;t be rid of, people like Ilya have to sacrifice, but people like Barnes can continue to do whatever they want, can we only accept it?&quot;, Kim replied: &quot;Who Say what you need? You just need to live here to live, and then live happily every day.&quot; War is the external cause of hardship, the external force that exists at all times, tearing up the disguise of people, and the people under the influence of humanity have different ways. Finally, Taylor does not kill himself. Did you die in Barnes? People are hell. In the extreme environment of war, there is no disguise. To live is the purpose. Director Oliver Stone once said that no one wants to fight. Everyone just wants to live and go home. It is this. Your death is my living environment that has spawned a scene of human tragedy. The people in the war are sad. They are all slaves to the system, the machines of war, the expensive equipment on their backs, just to kill anyone who threatens to survive. The war is not about patriotism. The war is actually The war between people, the war between man and humanity, the compromise of human nature on the issue of survival &quot;achieves&quot; the cruelty of war. Taylor finally thought about the whole war on the helicopter. He thought that they were fighting against the enemy but their own. The enemy was in theirIn my heart. Director Kubrick&#39;s &quot;All Metal Shell&quot; also conveys similar information. No matter how upright you are at first, in the midst of war, you will always expose the dark side of your humanity for survival. In the war, people are hell, so everyone in the war is in hell, and the war becomes the grave of humanity. The most painful thing in the war is not to die, but to lose oneself step by step. Oliver Stone directed another work, &quot;Natural Murderer&quot;. I think he believes in human nature. Everyone is born to be a murderer. This may be one of the reasons why he chose to present the Vietnam War in this way. But I also believe that goodness in human nature is also an important part of it. In an environment like war, in order to survive, the evil in human nature has fallen to the goodness of human nature, but we cannot ignore the importance of goodness, just as the film ends with Taylor. &quot;In any case, we have the responsibility to rebuild society and teach others what we know. We have to use the rest of our lives to find the meaning of life.&quot; There is a saying on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington: &quot;Anything in your war against Vietnam Before a general, general statement, you should first understand what the bottom line is. The bottom line is that many people go there and are killed; for them, this is the meaning of war.&quot; War is cruel, human It should not be in the midst of war. Many of the patriotic educations today make people look too arrogant about the war. They advertised the idea of â€‹â€‹defending the country and gave the war a grand excuse. But there is no righteous party in the war. Humanity is the ultimate in war. The victims, countless soldiers walked out of the war with a distorted view of life, so society It will produce tragedy so many veterans mental problems caused. But the war has never stopped. Churchill believes that World War II is a war that can be avoided, but which war is really inevitable? Can the goodness of human nature be suppressed by evil again and again? Those who have unfortunately experienced the war, and who have a clear understanding of the war, should stop this kind of humanity disaster from happening once again, and carry forward the warm and kind side of human nature, which is worthy of everyone who died in the war. This may be this one. The information the film wants to convey.",movie

701,"The type of film that was trapped in prison for &quot;good guys&quot; to wash the grievances was two in the 93 and 94 years. The box office was excellent, and they were all selected for the Oscar for Best Picture. They were &quot;The Desperate End of the World&quot; and &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;. ã€‹. Their success is the maturity of the type of film, the fusion of the type elements, the dominance of American culture, in a typical dramatic plot space, telling the audience that the audience loves watching and the filmmakers praise the film. These two films are countless scriptwriting materials. As a standard. Desperate is a typical three-screen structure film, which lasts about 130 minutes. Basically, the structure of each scene is 30:60:30, the golden ratio of American movies. It is a standard Hollywood structure film. The first act tells the story of the protagonist Jin Bo who was caught in the murder of his wife and was sentenced to death by the court and escaped unexpectedly. The second act tells Jinbo to discover the truth about his wifeâ€™s death and fight with the judicial officer Gila. The third act is that Jin Bo digs into the truth and the old friend Charlie &quot;duel&quot; to elute his grievances. What do you want to look at for a successful film analysis? The first is its plot. So what is the plot? It is defined in the Modern Chinese Dictionary as: changes and passages of things. So analyzing the plot of a movie is to analyze the passage of the main characters in the film and the final changes in his experience. There are three important issues with the change and the passing of things: First, what kind of things we need, that is the typical plot. Second, what kind of changes do we need? This is a rhythm problem. Third, what kind of experience we need, this is the details of the film. The plot setting of &quot;Desperate&quot; is a very dramatic and typical plot. Mrs. Jin Bo suffered murder, and all indications are that Jin Bo is the biggest murderer. The good beginning plot is set like a dynamic heart. He gives the whole movie a motivation. With the help of a good narrative, he makes this plot better. Therefore, the opening setting of &quot;Desperate End of the World&quot; is in a linear reproduction time and space, and a perforated structure that expresses the full flashback. The murder scene brought out by black and white negatives, quick editing and upgrade processing adds a sense of atmosphere. The scene of the scene in the car before the flash, the fundraising dinner, the interspersed with the operating room better assisted the narrative of the film. In terms of content and form, the film has already captured the audience. The reason is that it has a typical dramatic plot and a good audiovisual presentation of the movie.structure. Escape from this episode is particularly brilliant, he is the climax of the entire first act. The prison car is a confined space, the time is chosen for the night, and the jailbreak is expressed in this time and space. This is the environmental time to choose well. Imagine if you change the escape to the day, change to prison or other wider space. This tension will be inferior. The plot continued to develop. The car fell into the valley. One of the policemen was injured. Here, the whole line of sight was given to Jin Bo. What would he choose? Is it saved? Still fleeing? Still other? Not waiting for the development of this matter to end, a train immediately entered the scene. The policeman who had just righteous words first escaped from the car. Another black prisoner followed and escaped. Only Jin Bo was left. At this time, the rhythm has been raised. Soon, Jin Bo chose to save people and escaped when he was in a thousand. Carefully dissect this small scene, which has three emotional nodes: fighting in confined spaces, choices at critical moments, and escapes in crisis. The time and place of the plot selection are extremely extreme, with details and rhythm. There are still many similar plots for dealing with perfection, such as the first time that Gila has launched a &quot;vigilance chase&quot; scene: the location is chosen in a closed tunnel, the sewer, Jinbo is a person, walking, the other is a helicopter, fully armed, everything It is to force Jinbo to a crisis point and then develop, the tunnel finds the sewer, and the sewer jumps into the waterfall at the end. This jump also allowed the film to enter the second act: Jin Bo explored the truth. If the plot is the content of a movie, then the structure can be used as a form of film. What kind of structure and what kind of structure deals with the content of the film? This is a question related to the success or failure of the film. The structure is: from the whole: it is the beginning, development, climax, and end of a movie. It is the establishment, confrontation, and ending. From another perspective: what kind of means is used to tell the story: whether it is sequential, reversed, or inserted. . The main task of the first act, the film needs to let the audience quickly enter the story, establish the dramatic premise of the film, depict the story, establish the relationship between the main character and other people around him and around him, and empathize with the main character. &quot;Desperate End of the World&quot; has created the first act and its good atmosphere in a typical drama scene. Through the depiction of the main character Jinbo in several incidents, the task of the first act has been accomplished outstandingly. In the second stage of entering the film development stage, it can be made smaller in every scene, every paragraph, every scene.Divide its structure? The second act began with Jin Bo returning to Chicago to investigate the Cook County Hospital. He was locked in five suspects and found the killer Sikes who killed his wife. The second act is the longest in the movie. At this time, the dramatic needs of the main characters are already very clear. The characters need to encounter obstacles. The main action supporting the second act is confrontation. Jin Boâ€™s dramatic demand is to dig out the truth of murder and to grieve for himself. In the excavation of the truth, the obstacle is Gilaâ€™s obstruction. For Jinbo, first of all, it returned to Chicago, rented a house, had a stable habitat, and immediately began to investigate the Cook County Hospital, locked in five suspects, and found the killer Seck who killed his wife. Sis. In this narrative structure, it is Jila&#39;s follow-up to Jinbo. The two sides began to closely engage each other. What the audience saw was what Jinbo was doing and what Jila was doing. The way to improve the rhythm is that on the one hand, the audience urgently needs to see the truth, on the other hand, in this process, there are &quot;fighting&quot; of Gila and Jinbo. In order to pave the way and reverse the ending of the third act, when the relationship between Jin Bo and Gila was handled here, there was no confrontation between the two. Gila investigated Jinbo&#39;s residence, Jinbo was not at home, Jinbo just left in the hospital, Gila arrived, and the image of Jinbo in the eyes of Gila began to â€œpositivelyâ€ and went to investigate Yorkshire Hospital, in the structure of the narrative The relationship has been treated with time and space, and it has changed from a fight to a two-person collaboration. Although in the climax of the second act, Jinbo lurked in the judicial building, Gila arrived, and the two stairs met. In a positive conflict, Gila even fired a golden wave, but here is also a turning point in the extremes of things. After all, the narrative law is the law of life, and often things develop to the extreme and must develop in the other direction. There are two indirect positive interactions in the second act. There are two calls, one is to first arrive in Chicago, and the other is to discover the relationship between Sykes and Lanz. In the linear reproduction type of space-time processing, there are also two special spatio-temporal processing methods in the second scene. One was a nightmare, and the other was to find Lanzâ€™s pre-flash memories after arriving at Sikesâ€™s home. The nightmare is indeed a very good transitional transition. In the second act, Jinbo found the prosthesis in the hospital and forged the identity document that entered the inside and the drug dealerâ€™s son who took the renter from the police. This transition adjusts the rhythm, the audience is in a tense plotThere is also a need for proper relaxation. This relaxation is the treatment of a very expressive dream. After that, the rhythm rises again and the police come to the house to search. In the character clues, the dream shows the character&#39;s anxiety, anxiety, helplessness, and the audience can better sympathize with the hero. Its use is multi-faceted. Doing the structure is like cooking fresh, knowing when to use what, what to use and what to heat. The character is the soul of the movie, and the plot is under the bearing of the structure, which is the character. Throughout the history of the development of film types, there is a history of the development of type characters. Traditional types of movies require positive and negative polarization. Action films require a tough guy, and &quot;Desperate End of the World&quot; is the address of two tough guys: Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The two of them are like ice and fire, Ford&#39;s words, wit, Jones&#39;s self-confidence (and even a little conceit) the image of a big man. The performances of the two actors have made the characters lively. Through the choice of the things that the characters encounter, our trust in the two characters has been established. The third act is also the climax of the film, in which the characters begin to enrich and the relationship between the characters is more abundant. On the one hand, Jin Bo, Gila, on the other hand, Sikes, Lanzi, Charlie, and the symbolic faint Chicago. police. The relationship between the characters here is Jin Bo and Gila, Jin Bo and Sykes, Jin Bo and Lan Zi, Jin Bo and Charlie, Gila and Sykes, Gila and Charlie, Lanzi and Charlie, the third scene of good movies often It will reverse the story of the film, especially the evaluation of his type of action and suspense. He has become the most important element. Charlie became the real opposite. The film also completed his reversal. In the film, his possession and his present performance were clever. The first act, the second act is his hidden passage, and the third act is his performance. paragraph. The relationship between Jin Bo and Gila is from a positive struggle to a more cooperative to enemy. The success of the characters is the main character that makes the audience empathize. It is the richness of the network of people&#39;s relationships. It is the extreme of the conflict of characters. It is the highlight of the supporting role to the subject. All of them are in the &quot;Desperate End of the World&quot;. From David Porter&#39;s &quot;The Big Robbery of the Train&quot; as the prototype of Western movies and action films, the type film has been more than one hundred years old, from the earliest simple type, the formulation of the product to the present has developed into many types. Fusion. &quot;Desperate&quot; is the product of action, suspense, vigilance, crime, and the integration of various types of buddies. This fusion enriches the narrative of the film and makes the film more visible. To the firstThe third act not only has the action elements in the action movie, such as the Jinbo, Charlie, and Gila three fights at the press conference, and the revealing of the mystery in the suspense film, even Jinboâ€™s friend Charlie is the manipulator behind the scenes, and the conspiracy behind the crime film. The fuse of all these incidents is the dissatisfaction of human desires, the type of buddies, the sorrows of the two men, and the two people in the car at the end of the movie are full of ambiguous conversations. What is the further look at the type of movie? It is based on a story that is enjoyable. It is a kind of mainstream cultural output. American culture is a mixed culture. Its biggest feature is individual heroism. Its characters are also high, big and full. It is a typical positive person, a handsome tough guy, a blind man, a wit, a kindness, a compassion, and no offense. The most important element of the character as the theme, the establishment of the character is also the establishment of the theme. Through the narrative of the plot, the most superficial theme is justice over evil. Potentially, it also promotes the advantages of American politics. It is the cooperation between individual heroism and the judiciary that completes the prohibition of evil. Although you see many American Hollywood films, many of them are promoting ugly American politics. Under this kind of politics, There must be a leading role for people within the upper level. The development of Hollywood movies is indeed a good thing, that is, earning money, and completing the political stability in the country and the export of American culture abroad. After analyzing this, it is also the end of the film review, Chinese film has also reached a period of transformation and development, especially how to promote it for mainstream type movies. It is a copy of Hollywood in the United States, or it is processed and borrowed under the soil of China. The author is more esteemed by the latter. China&#39;s martial arts film, successfully borrowed and processed by Hollywood, has the success of today&#39;s &quot;Death of the World&quot;. Chinese film needs to refine the type of film, relax a part of the review, and make the creator have a wider range of creative freedom. After all, whether the film is technology or art, culture or morality, all the workers engaged in film have the ambition of the literati. The Hong Kong film &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; and Scorsese&#39;s &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, I prefer the former. The former is a pirate with a broad Chinese philosophy. It also sacrifices the essence of China&#39;s five thousand years of philosophical and philosophical heritage. It is much superficial. I believe that in the future, Chinese-style film culture will be rich, and domestic action films will become a high-quality film that competes with Hollywood.ã€‚",movie
702,"&quot;Terror Live&quot; is a commercial movie. Many people are biased against commercial movies, either a bucket of popcorn or something on the audience&#39;s face. However, if it is considered that the commercial film is not high in nutrition and not worth mentioning, such judgment is also wrong. For a long time, the Chinese audience fell into the misunderstanding of watching movies. They watched art movies as more than the high-end of commercial movies, and commercial movies and the art films. In fact, a movie is only good or bad. There is no need to distinguish between business and art. It does not matter whether it is mainstream or independent. Itâ€™s the top priority to watch movies. Learning to â€œwatch the art artisticallyâ€ is the top priority. With so much, it is of course related to &quot;Terror Live&quot;. This film not only has topics and phenomena, but also has the artistic pursuit of the creators. In addition to the brief departure from the opening and some large panoramic views of the city, this film is almost rare to completely compress and limit the space scene in the studio. In the amazing scene of the end of the explosion, the protagonist did not leave the room, but with a calm smile. Most commercial films don&#39;t dare to play this way. The audience is easy to be visually exhausted. Secondly, the requirements for drama and actors are very high. As a result, &quot;Terror Live&quot; was done, using the telephoto switch to complete the connection, using the close-up and sound to create tensions, and bursting out the greatest drama energy in a limited time. &quot;Terror Live&quot; has turned everyday life into a blank, and there are no curious and frightening street spectators. From the beginning of the broadcast program, it is in an extremely compact and chaotic state of drama. For the anchor Yin Yinghua, this is equivalent to shielding all his past, and he did not leave the scene. He is not a normal person in the simple sense. He is an intermediate mediator. He needs to talk to terrorists. Personal personal affairs will also be turned over and broadcast live, even if it is only part of conspiracy theory. But in other words, only in front of the camera, a media talent is real, vivid and lively. The film also tells the audience that the media and the media are nothing more than a fictional image that has been fabricated by post-processing. It is often not a person, but a filtered collective opinion, a label and a symbol. On the surface, the media has enough space for discourse, the freedom to criticize and expose, to face the state machine, it is ultimately too weak to play. Many Korean movies have turned out to be old and no-headed, in order to lash out the government, criticize its arbitrary dictatorship, and blame human life. The government is disappointed with the bureaucracy. These are really not new, but like&quot;Terror Live&quot; is so rare that it is so cramped and hated. When it comes to the point of terrorist attacks, in fact, the weak side has given up the possibility of dialogue. &quot;Terrorist Live&quot; has been waiting for a symbolic presidential apology, and people can&#39;t help but think of Hong Zhongqiu&#39;s case on the streets of Taipei. Otherwise, there is also a ridicule of politicians in the British drama &quot;Black Mirror&quot;. The film does not have a blind anti-system, and it is not a conflict riot that pursues anarchism as soon as it comes up. For a long time, Yin Yinghua was trying hard to try? Even if this kind of effort is hypocritical, with the natural sense of smell and utilitarianism of the media, he still hopes to save the innocent people on the bridge (with his ex-wife inside). He also threw out the pains of a sound law and a change of system, but it did not work. Successive defeats and the appearance of terrorist attacks and bloody scenes caused him to fall into a psychological collapse, thus disintegrating his inherent personality at the beginning, returning to the normal human nature, sympathy, fear, wit, anxiety, and mixed feelings. Speak for yourself. Even he said an apology instead of the president, but these did not prevent him from becoming a terrorist. As Yang Dechang said in the 1986 &quot;Terrorists&quot;, a normal social person, no matter how harmful his appearance, may become a terrorist. Because you really don&#39;t know, disasters and bad luck will come to you someday. The difference is that Yang Dechang is disappointed with the middle class and Taipei life, and &quot;Terror Live&quot; is not specific to the whole society. When high-rise buildings are pressed to the South Korean parliament like dominoes, people who are in it may not be able to break away from it. This is also a tragedy that is often staged in the surrounding reality. Everyone is sitting in a train of dying, in a gunpowder barrel, and at the same time facing a tall building that is about to collapse. Perhaps like Jia Zhangke said, this is destined.

704,"There aren&#39;t many things about excellent classic running books. I think there are many reasons. First, the development of running sports in China is not particularly good. Although the running population is rising year by year, it is still not much. Second, most of the excellent books are from foreign countries, and there are very few translations. And &quot;3 minutes and 58 seconds in the rain&quot; is one of the more classic ones. This book was bought earlier. It has been bought for a long time when I actually saw it. I have taken this book several times on business, but basically nothing. I have touched it, because there are reasons for being lazy or too much, and because I have a natural resistance to foreign books, most of the books are not easy to read. This book is also true, and I feel that the narrative is very messy. I went to Beijing to run the North Horse plus Jinan for six days. This book is outside. I have never seen it on a page. I always feel sorry for it. After I came back, I felt that my performance was good. I have to touch these. As for the books on running, I started reading this book. The actor in the book, Cassidy, is an excellent 1600-meter runner. He is one meter tall and eight-eight. Because of his special mission, he must maintain a slim body of 75 kilograms. He has no slack in his body or Clam meat, rest and sleep when the heart beats thirty-two. This book is about his story about running this dream and his touching love. There are a lot of details about their training, such as the morning run. For Cassidy, there is no fun in the routine of the morning run. He sleeps poorly and wakes up slowly. But I got up at 7:30 and ran for 27 kilometers. This is the only way they can enjoy the sweetness of cider without feeling full of guilt. Of course, they can also put the practice run in the evening, but this will only be more disappointing. Can&#39;t touch beer! Not to mention shochu! It&#39;s best to do all the things you need to do, so that you can enjoy the good times like everyone else. The description in the book makes me feel the same, I think the morning run is also the same, it makes your day longer, you can complete more than running, and there is no embarrassment. Excellent runners are excellent runners. In the morning running training, the runners can&#39;t afford the speed. These players can handle them easily, and they can play along the way. But they also have their own etiquette. Occasionally, when they roar from the angry fat man or the older jogger, they will automatically drop the volume so that they don&#39;t feel embarrassed and don&#39;t want people to think they are Show off. In fact, they respect these things with great respect.The same spirit is running, after all, in the vast sea of â€‹â€‹people, only these people have a similarities with them. However, if you compare long-distance runners with the average jogger, it is like a comparison between a cougar and a pet cat. Finding prey in the jungle and stretching on the carpet are two very different things. The difference is huge. In the book, their training intensity and physical endurance are really astounding. There are a lot of rumors about running in the book, which gives people a deeper understanding of running, such as the following paragraphs. You won&#39;t become a champion because you win a morning exercise. The only truth is that you must know how to control your fierce ambitions during practice for days, weeks, months, or even years. Lu Yao knows horsepower. Most of the runners are arrogant, they will treat the better than their own with respect and fear, but treat people who are slower than themselves with sympathy or tolerance. The ecstasy of a quick second is like adding a new life to the home. A racer is like a miser. He always cares about his energy. He has to know how much energy he has spent and how much he has to pay. He just wants to go bankrupt at the moment he doesn&#39;t need money. On the runway, we have been working hard to keep an eye on our achievements, not only to compete with today&#39;s players, but also to compare them with historical predecessors. In this regard, the situation of various sports is not the same. A basketball player can be said that he is the most powerful rebounder, but no one will ever find him trouble with this matter. Because he is likely to play a small alliance with weak strength. On the runway, everything is black and white, and many people can&#39;t withstand that pressure. Under the digital gaze, the self gradually shrinks. And we all have ourselves, which is why numbers are so important to us, why are we always talking about numbers? The runners almost think about what they want when they are training, but when they really play, everyone thinks the same thing, that is, the game. The book also describes a lot of Cassidy training life. For example, his diet, the calories burned by athletes is equivalent to the consumption of all the people in a small town. It seems that the particularly thin long-distance runners eat far more than you can imagine (Cassidy put three fried eggs in the plate, two pancakes, sausage, nearly one liter of milk, plus two doughnuts after the meal ). The year of Cassidy, a year of runners, can be divided into three parts. Autumn is the off-road long-distance running season. This ten-kilometer long-distance running season starts from the high temperature of the early autumn with dry heat.Ending on the cold muddy, the winter that followed was the indoor season. Spring and early summer are what Denton calls the real track. I have to say that Denton is a very important character in the book. He is a very important person to Cassidy. Denton, the Olympic champion, in the first year of the Institute, Denton, who had a flat performance, ran 10 kilometers, 27 minutes and 10 seconds. Entering the Institute of Southeast University and re-starting a solid devil training here, aiming to win the bid. He showed a firm willpower, and the daily road training was no less than twice, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year, every day. On the rainy day in November, he was sick in bed because of the epidemic, vomiting from time to time, and diarrhea was severe enough to the stomach. However, he still got up and went out, screaming and running for three kilometers, and his face was pale and trembling. His wife was scared. In the afternoon, he repeated the same road run. This time, when he walked back to the apartment, he almost fainted to the ground. The doctor rushed into Denton&#39;s bedroom and said that he was a madman. &quot;Where am I crazy?&quot; Denton asked, the two dry lips squeezing out a smile. &quot;Today, I have been 25 kilometers behind this week.&quot; There is no such thing as a secret in training! If he really wants to move towards the championship, he must run for dozens of kilometers a day, and such days will be longer than you think. Denton insisted on improving the mileage of the running. No matter how tired the weekend of the Xiangjis Cup Road Race, he still had to run 37 kilometers on the following Monday and ran a total of 200 kilometers in a week. It seems that there is no sign of laxity in the future. In addition to his practice or running, his degree of attachment is like a crazy kangaroo who suddenly encounters big water and clings to the trunk. He believes that life has become more than just morbidity. And the training of Denton is generally a madman. At this juncture, most people will retreat. Soon after, everyone will disappear collectively. They will convince themselves that there should be other training methods, there must be! The breakage rate is almost 100%. Only Cassidy and Mizner completed the training process and accepted the mileage test. I feel that the training has also reduced the resistance of Denton and Cassidy. One afternoon of training has caused Cassidy to lose three kilograms. Such strong people will also get sick and hurt. For example, in the book, Cassidyâ€™s left leg, Achilles, feels very fragile, and the stronger people pay more attention to the injury, and they must pay attention to the situation later.Turn. In fact, I think that the part of the novel that is still ok should be the last, and it will start in the mountains after Cassidyâ€™s accident. He quickly developed an amazing lifestyle: rigorous training, lots of reading, a simple diet, sometimes hibernation like a bear, and talking to the pots and pans. Such an awkward life has also made Cassidy&#39;s final victory, but there are several people who can bear this kind of life, but this kind of life is also a little single, some pure, can make people continue to move toward a goal. During this time, Denton often brought some new books to Cassidy, a hermit who avoided the mountain. These books were all related to running. Reading made Cassidy gain a lot, and these few books helped him to pay attention. Focus on running. Although these novels are somewhat embarrassing in their writing skills, they occasionally have some hard work experience. They find comfort in these books, and the content of biographies is much deeper. He learned from his biography that he was not lonely. Often, he spent a whole day reading crazy. Late at night, he regained his energy and ran a section on the country roads and forest trails to take himself and his seniors. Runners or fictional characters make a comparison. It can be said that this period of time gave Cassidy strong spiritual support. During this period, Denton gave Cassidy a lot of help, constantly training him, urging him, and having the most classic dialogue in the book. &quot;Did you run today?&quot; &quot;Can the fish in the water? Swim? I have already ran, do you think I came to make friends with the farmer?&quot;, Cassidy&#39;s answer is quite heart-warming, especially for the public runners. There is also a chapter on intermittent running, which is very deep in the description of Cassidy&#39;s training. Interval training is a series of running exercises that are completed at specific distances, times and rest modes. The coach&#39;s imagination and the athlete&#39;s physical limit. Running at 10,400 meters, limited to 58 seconds, between each sprint is a two-hundred-meter jog, easy to write, but the real implementation is completely different. Cassidy also said: &quot;Interval training is a kind of tempering, and long-distance runners use this method to push their endurance to the limit.&quot; The intermittent running practice described in the novel is 20,400 meters running. Divided into five rounds, each run is a one-meter jog, between each round is 400 meters of jogging, each time as much as possible to control about 63 seconds. The key to such training is not how fast it can run, but how tired it is.How fast can you run when you are tired? Recovery is the key: the faster a person recovers, the faster he runs. This exercise was supervised by Denton. Cassidy finally completed the sixty horror of the horror. Among them, Denton continued to encourage and stimulate. &quot;Cassidy, here is the place to discover the ultimate ability of self, is now! Just in Here! Others are deceptive.&quot; &quot;Listen, the runner is to adapt to the physical discomfort. When you go beyond that level, the rest is easy to handle. There is no secret at all. I know you can do it, Because I also did it, and at the moment I finished, I had a very important experience.â€ This horrible interval training made Cassidy sleep for a full seventeen hours and was unable to get up and let him in the toilet. It is full of hematuria, but the experience is only known to him. The final game won 3 minutes and 52 seconds 5, which is also his best award. The book also describes the love of Cassidy and Aria. The words of Amelia tell the feelings of people in love. &quot;When we are together, I don&#39;t know if I am particularly happy, because everything is ordinary, but when he is not with me, except waiting for him. Come back, I can&#39;t seem to do anything else.&quot; Also, in order to see the side of Anlia, Cassidy ran for 19 kilometers in heavy rain, and then ran 19 kilometers back. In order to tell her the misunderstanding between the two, in order to tell her that she has broken through the four-minute limit, reaching 3 minutes and 58 seconds, how romantic and touching this plot is. For us, the thrill of overcoming anyone is better than defeating yourself, and running is the best choice for this victory. This is written by a netizen on the Internet. The citation is the end of this article. Yes, running is such a charm. Cassidy thinks this way, and we think so.",movie

The works of modern writers always have a strange similarity (may be limited to mainland writers). When I read &quot;Taipei People&quot; in half, I felt very clearly in my heart that this is what I think of storytelling. These stories are connected in series, presenting the great era of Taiwan after the civil war. Especially the scene of the mainland people who have migrated in the past, exquisite, lively, degenerate, broken.... These stories have drawn the hearts of their fellow citizens. We are the same as them, we talk to them. It is one, this is the human emotion and thinking.

Whether volunteering in Wenchuan or teaching in Tibetan areas or Kashgar all year round, it is not only necessary to have inner love and dedication, but also to suffer and endure loneliness. However, she still can&#39;t agree with her way of leaving her young daughter. China&#39;s education needs someone to give, but her daughter needs her more. Since she has chosen to bring a life to this world, she should be responsible for it, not to pursue the peace and destiny of her soul. There are things that can be waited for, and there are no chances to make up for some things to miss. I remember reading a pair of Belgian couples with 5 and 9 years old daughters who used Wanli Road instead of reading thousands of books. If the author really has the heart, why not bring his daughter to share such an experience? The author mentioned in his preface that the purpose of this book is to record the teaching experience of the year in the form of novels, so it is no accident that the joys, sorrows and sorrows of Tibetan teaching are vivid and credible, and the love story is superficial. The cookie cutter, whether it is the section of Shanghai or the section of Tibet. Life and death are of course lyrical, but after all, it is still too deliberate.

711,"After reading &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; in one night, my heart was not calm. The scene chosen by the author seems to be very familiar. I often imagine the identity of everyone walking in the bustling streets. She or he should be with the sadness and joy, what kind of mood is on the street, she or he What are you going to do, but the mood has passed by, but people have already gone, but at this node where people meet, it seems that time is solidified so little. The sorrows and sorrows of everyone walking in a huge city seem to be so small, and for the individual, it is almost the whole of life. For Yan Jiahui who is not married, the problem that she almost hard to overcome is money. Although money is only a material foundation, it determines her whole spiritual life. She can&#39;t get married, her future is lost, and her mind is awkward. She even almost gave up her bottom line for the house. Zhao Bing, a foreign college student who lacks money, lacks social identity and urban integration. He has been on the edge of the city for a few years. He also feels that the city is surrounded by a thick layer of Durex. Can&#39;t break through? The married state also seems to be much better. The Li world, where the economy is not problematic, the family life is stable and comfortable, but his swaying heart begins to seek his young boyâ€™s dream, even if the dream is covered with a beautiful veil, the inside has already fester. Another Yuan Liming, who was on the verge of a marriage crisis, got married but lost in the siege. He and his wife both forgot how they loved each other and came together. The romantic and charming fairy-tale snow night is not enough. The millennium is milled. The reporter who was forced to leave the besieged city was confused from the arms of one girl to the arms of another girl. Did he love it? Is he now in love? He does not know it himself. In the flashback of the movie montage, perhaps the most deeply touched is the singer&#39;s &quot;Scorpio&quot; and Yuan Liming&#39;s &quot;Open Eyes&quot;. Perhaps it is strong and tenacious, like Scorpio, and you will lose yourself because of the pressure of life. Those who can&#39;t get out of the left and right can&#39;t get out of it. It&#39;s like a shadow. It will kill your will a little bit, and the pain of Jiahui may be like many young people. I have a deep understanding, you can choose to sit in the back seat of the bicycle, but can you always laugh in the back seat of the bicycle? Some pains and difficulties are real and inescapable. But Scorpio finally made a judgment with a clear mind, even if there is no bicycle back seat to sit, even if I have to walk or even squeeze the bus, whichI am afraid that I will lose more, and I must also have the bottom line of sticking to my own life. And between Yuan Liming and Xue Tian, â€‹â€‹there is still attachment to each other. The marriage in marriage is the deepest philosophy of life. Whoever does not have to be punished will not be punished. The wifeâ€™s consideration for home is not the sweetness of the past, the life of the city, the husband. Then turn a blind eye to his wife&#39;s feelings. This pair is the most regrettable to me. When the last warmth is inextricably divided, the situation has turned sharply. This may be the black humor of the author. This is the little story of a few ordinary people on Christmas Eve, those who are confused about the future, those who are disappointed with reality, those who are middle-aged, those who are young, those who are not painful or depressed or flustered. A festive night looks so light, it makes people difficult to walk, and it looks so huge, it is so unbearable. Every soul needs a fulcrum. The fulcrum of a woman may be a man. The fulcrum of a man may be a career, a family, or even a little stimulation. But more often, women and men follow their own fluttering soul, lonely. Walking, you can no longer find your own fulcrum.",movie
712,"When I saw that &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; finally appeared in the domestic cinema exhibition, the eyes were filled with happy tears. After more than a year, it has experienced all kinds of bumps. This animation, which was already released in North America in 2012. The film has finally been introduced to the country. I have always had an inexplicable affection for animated films. Whether it is Disney, Pixar or this Sony animation, this type of Hollywood is always easy to get close to and impress us. It may be that most people are childlike, or they may be Virtual animation techniques make it easier to express some emotions. These adults are like a group of children waiting to be fed in front of these animated films. They are also rendered and experienced. The biggest charm of animated films, I am afraid that all kinds of funny characters can not be added, and the same is true of &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;. Even the &quot;Dracula&quot; image of the classic vampires that have been portrayed countless times has been made into small objects. Who can still be terrible in an animated film, think about the horrible vampire in &quot;Frightening Four Hundred Years&quot;, and then look at the cute father in &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;, the comedy effect is slowly flowing in this great contrast. come out. In fact, itâ€™s not just â€œDraculaâ€. The various monsters in The Elf Hostel are also lovely, like the Frankenstein with a line of threads, the werewolves with a group of disobedient children, the silly mummies, no The zombies that accompany the plants, and even the invisible people who have never had a face in the whole article, the cuteness of these monsters is really more than that of &quot;Monsters University&quot;. In addition to hilarious animation movies, the biggest feature is the expression of &quot;warm feelings&quot;, &quot;Elves Hostel&quot; also tells a story of &quot;warm father love.&quot; In order to keep her daughter Mefeisi away from humans and protect her daughter&#39;s safety, Dracula built a castle and wanted her daughter to live by her life.

Seeing Mephis falling in love, As a father, Dekura tried to stop, but in the end, she saw her daughter all day long and depressed, and she remembered her long-lost lover. She opened her heart with her daughter and braved the burning sun to recover the Johnny. . I like the words in the movie very much. &quot;I always thought that the worst situation is that you left me. In fact, what makes me most sad is that you are not happy.&quot; In fact, many of us are like Dracula, living in their own world all day, not willing to face new things,Although it is very safe, but this kind of life is boring and boring, it is because of this, we missed a lot, and will inadvertently hurt many people&#39;s hearts, it is time to look outside bravely, for yourself, and to love you and you Beloved person. I always think that this movie &quot;Crazy Primitives&quot; is quite like, there is no big villain, and some are just the monologue of fatherly love. Whether it is Dracula or Gua Ge, they inherit the characteristics of the great father and give everything for their children. The biggest role of animated films is that it allows viewers to slowly accept this emotional venting in the midst of excitement. This kind of movie that is suitable for the whole family to watch together is very rare. This kind of true expression is a real-life movie. It is difficult to reflect.",movie

A 20-year-old rebellious girl fell in love with a 38-year-old uncle who has been painstakingly cared for for a few years to come, but it is inevitable that she will encounter the difficulties brought about by the age gap, and sometimes it will be strong and sometimes strong. The practical or sexy or gentle rivals, I believe, will make the reality of the little beautiful girl who is controlled by the uncle to produce a lot of resonance. By Shen Xiaole, a character who does not give up on love, &quot;I love you, love me&quot; from Yapeng&#39;s male perspective? More accurately, from the perspective of a party and a guilty person, tells a story. The cruel law of love, the ones who are hurt in the emotional world are always deeper and pay more. Whoever loves more, whoever loses. Another law that makes people feel sad is that it is difficult for Luo Li to overcome the reality and completely capture the uncle, just like Shen Xiaole. It is not young or beautiful, but in the inner world of Yapeng, she is always a playmate. It is not suitable for marriage.

716,"The title of &quot;Contra Battle Li Siqiang&quot; is that I thought about it at the moment I learned that the movie existed. Although I was overwhelmed by many media, I still didn&#39;t change my mind. The two muscle male protagonists in the 80&#39;s classic game &quot;Contra&quot; are the Stallone of &quot;The First Blood 2&quot; and the Schwarzenegger of &quot;The Dragon Boat&quot;. For many years, action fans such as the author, have been looking forward to seeing the two most obsessive screen tough guys in the Western world, can work together for a customs clearance. In addition to the 1990s, the two men used posters and lines in the movie to spoof each other. Shishi and Shishi have already appeared in the two &quot;Death Squad&quot; and will continue to cooperate in the third. However, &quot;The Death Squad&quot; is only a heroic group under the leadership of Stallone, and our &quot;Contra&quot; movie in our minds must have only two major protagonists on the poster. It must be &quot;Left Shi Shi Shi&quot; sweeping the army. The plot must have the iconic scenes of the two of them walking side by side, all around, and of course, it is best to let them do the same. The &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is also completely satisfied with the above requirements, and it is enough to call the real version of &quot;Contra&quot;. And &quot;John Reese&quot; is the protagonist of the American drama &quot;The Tracker of the Suspects&quot;, and the actor Jim Kaweize plays the villain in the &quot;Golden Shell&quot;. When I first watched the drama, I felt that Uncleâ€™s thin face, hazy eyes, and low voices (especially the shuddering power when depressed) were too suitable for Batmanâ€™s performance. No less than Master Wayne, I am very happy that my vision is recognized by Hollywood producers. For the fans who are familiar with the image of the uncle of the card, the corner of the warden will not cause resentment. He has no swearing, no basics, no dirty hands, and still has a smart suit, a flexible mind, a slow talk and a hidden murder. It is still the &quot;suit hero&quot; Li Siqiang that everyone likes, but it has been blackened. Generally speaking, due to the contract, the American TV drama has a long working time and few chances to play a big production movie. Uncle Ka is lucky. He can challenge the two legendary superstars with the role of the alternative Li Siqiang. It is a glorious resume. It is not the first time that Stallone has escaped from prison in the movie. Coincidentally, the last time &quot;Rage Tiger Crazy Dragon&quot; is also a double drama. Only this time, he began to lay the illusion of loneliness, and when Arno appeared, I noticed the time, more than half an hour passed. However, this move did not reduce the importance of Arnoldâ€™s role, knowing that the â€œGreat Gatesâ€ Ridika alsoIt was only 30 minutes before it came out. After entering the opponent&#39;s play, the two sides began to form a comparison with the fans for more than 30 years of performance style. Stallone is like a lone wolf in the wilderness, resourceful and resourceful, and constantly showing the will, the superb penetration skills, and the iron plate. The expression, everything is the immortal impression of the &quot;First Blood&quot; series. Arnoldâ€™s expressiveness shows his sense of humor. It is well known that this has always been a strong place for him than Stallone. There is a bag of jokes saying, â€œSay itâ€™s a fake fight.â€ There is a poor smile, â€œGo to the hardware store to buy you oneâ€, Show a very yellow and very violent comics. As for the climax of heavy machine guns sweeping, eyes close-up, the audience exclaimed, &quot;Solo Dragon&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot; charm reappear. Objectively speaking, it is not difficult to make a film to bring these two together. After all, the two men have been hit by the box office Waterloo. Although it is cruel, cooperation is indeed the only way out. However, it is necessary to take the double-male route, and to retain the classic memories of the two, it is necessary to make some tricks. &quot;Golden Shell Unshell&quot; allows us to discover without surprise. Stallone is still Stallone, Arnold or Arnold, they jumped into the same world from their respective screens in the 80s, and immediately cooperated without change. There is no barrier. The film also handled the comrades&#39; feelings very rough and rough, and did not leave a little bit of truth to the base. In today&#39;s two-story film=substrate, this also requires skill. Some friends said that as a high IQ movie, the strategy of &quot;Golden Dragonfly&quot; is too simple. First of all, I have to admit that when Prison Break is almost a compulsory course for college students, it depends on the real intellectual challenge and the impossible task. &quot;Golden Dragonfly&quot; is really just a pediatrics. But from another angle, considering the original intention of the film is the retro 80s, this fighting version of Contra, although the guns changed into the mind, the bunker replaced the isolation door, still must unswervingly implement the &quot;simple and rude&quot; style, If the layout is interlocked with the &quot;Eleven Arhats&quot;, as long as the last toilet can not keep up, it is not compatible with the identity of the two tough guys. So in my opinion, the plan is simple, the plot is transparent, and it is the advantage of the film. The use of high technology also belongs to the point, transparent ban, camera, motion sensing, is the limit of props, and finally have legs, fists and bullets to talk.

I have always heard that Lincolnâ€™s character is perfect, as great as it is, but this text is definitely not to praise him, just to remember the important things he has done, and to make himself more Know what is most important. After telling the telegrapher about the contents of Captain Sanders, Lincoln meditated and asked the two telegraphers, &quot;Can we decide our birth?&quot; &quot;Can we guarantee that we are born?&quot; Not important, I think it&#39;s more important to know when you should do something. There must be courage to take responsibility. This may be more important. Lincoln, who was at that position in that era, has been working hard for what he should do, and he is also responsible for what he should bear. This is enough. History remembered him and remembered them. When the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America was passed, people celebrated in the song, that joy is talking about the pursuit of freedom. She let people see that the country is on the right path and is walking in hope. On the road. It is also her, let the road of the United States go further and further, and go wider and wider.

718,"I have never read a book published by Jiang Fangzhou. I only know that she is a talented girl. She started writing at the age of seven. In the 16-year writing process, she published many books and won many awards. She is very famous. . &quot;I admit that I have never experienced vicissitudes&quot; is her tenth work. As a peer of me, after reading this book, of course, the feeling is very deep. Just like the short text on the cover of this book, &quot;The record itself is already rebellious.&quot; This sentence sounds very unpredictable. In fact, Jiang Fangzhou has made a good interpretation of it in the book. The purpose of writing this book, she is very clear, is to observe the society and experience life from the perspective of an ordinary person. In the preface &quot;There is no boy,&quot; she wrote: &quot;I temporarily gave up the summary of China, and went to observe the individual, seeing the micro. Every day we live, we are further left in the tomb of history. There is always a day. They are all specimens. It is also very interesting to be the producer of the specimens. Although there is no exaggerated language and ideological debates to attract people, it is unreasonable to be stupid, and some people have to come.&quot; Recording and observing the lives of ordinary people Is this stupid? I don&#39;t think that true literature and art care for the individual. Excellent movies and novels express the theme of the times through the depiction of the individual. The macroscopic and huge structures, without the support of the individual, are pale. Empty, powerless. For the care of the individual, the awakening of this consciousness is the growth of Jiang Fangzhou. What is the process of such growth? In the article &quot;I admit that I have never experienced vicissitudes of life&quot;, Jiang Fangzhou retracted and made the growth experience of our generation from childhood to study and made a montage-style lens replay. These descriptions are too strong, you Reading these words, you can immediately evoke the memories of the past, and describe some details, such as when you are in the third year of high school, everyone is immersed in hard work, even when the lights are in the night, when the people in the class eat, the sound of the bags is screaming. Hungry classmates are drooling. These things can be regarded as the collective memories of our generation. The discussion around the post-90s has been continuous since our adulthood. We were born in an era of no hunger and no disaster, no common memories of suffering, and no vicissitudes of our predecessors, so compared with their predecessors. Underneath, it will appear to be poor and not enough. These times give us stickersThe label on the label is slowly being picked up by us and then removed. After being removed, you can grow better. This book is a collection of essays, with her diary, a column she wrote for the magazine, her book review, and her understanding of family and life. Structurally, the three chapters respectively describe the reflections and perceptions of the lives of peers, literature and thought, and childhood. What impressed me is the third part, &quot;Trial of Childhood.&quot; She reinterprets the relationship between brothers and sisters, grandparents, parents and herself through a combination of psychology and sociology on the theory of intimacy, subverting our ideals for family relationships. Imagination. In fact, between the hands and feet, there will be a situation in which &quot;one egg can not be a second child&quot; and &quot;in order to survive, it can only become his opposite side&quot;. Grandparents will also use the name of family kinship to &quot;murder and love their grandchildren&quot;. In addition to our most basic moral imagination, parent-child relationship will also become lost due to the original animal impulse. These views are the most classic interpretations of intimacy in psychology and sociology. Jiang Fangzhou makes her own interpretations very powerful by citing the views and discourses of Freud and Jung. It may be the reason that belongs to the &quot;Guangxi Normal University Ideal Country Series&quot;. I always compare this book with Chai Jing&#39;s &quot;Seeing&quot;. In fact, the temperament of these two books is very similar. &quot;Seeing&quot; is a reporter. Chai Jing uses his own personal experience to record the social changes in China in the past 10 years. This book is to interpret life through the perspective of a young female writer. Interpretation of growth is the literary young woman&#39;s perception of life and society. However, it may be the relationship between reason and experience. Chai Jingâ€™s writing skills and emotional expression are more sophisticated than Jiang Fangzhouâ€™s, calmer and deeper. These are all questions of time. However, as Jiang Fangzhouâ€™s peers, her writings have long been expected. Although I have not read her previous works, I believe that this book is a new starting point and beginning for her. From this book, you can also see Jiang Fangzhou&#39;s efforts. A large number of citations, covering various fields, show that she has done a lot of work on reading, and also has her own unique style. However, this kind of storytelling is introduced, then talk about your own thoughts, then introduce them, and then talk about ideas. Such a model may make people feel that there is a kind of soul chicken soup, and more references, natural things. It is less. The highest state of reference is that no traces are left. If a book is readAfter finishing the feeling of reading notes, it is a bit lacking. Of course, this is a postscript, and it is a pertinent suggestion. After all, Jiang Fangzhou represents our generation and represents the vicissitudes of our experience.",movie
719,"What is the core topic and core clue of &quot;Imperial Country&quot;? What is the motivation of Plato&#39;s writing? Plato&#39;s writing of this book is for those people to see. These are very difficult to grasp. The first question to discuss, perhaps justice, may be the soul, or it may be the completion of an ideal city state. Judging from the traditional Chinese translation of &quot;The Republic of China&quot;, I don&#39;t know how many people are only plainly understood as Plato&#39;s dream of being a philosopher&#39;s ideal priest. Itâ€™s true that Platoâ€™s work does indeed describe such a city-state that must be sacred by the philosopher, and that the philosopher is forced to be king in such a city-state. However, such a depiction only occupies less than half of the entire chapter of the book, and how to grasp the rest of the book, especially the beginning of the first volume, completely without mentioning any ideal city state, all discussions begin with philosophers. Socrates was forced to stay in the harbor. In order to get out of trouble, he was forced to fight and debate with the people of all walks of life, especially in the first volume, the confrontation between Socrates and Trasius Marcus. For example, in the eighth and ninth volumes of the book, the discussion on the evolution of the five city-state polities, the tenth volume of the writing of Aier mythology, these parts are more difficult to relate directly to the construction of the ideal city-state and the philosopher to the king, not to mention the relationship. The fifth and sixth volumes of &quot;The Republic of China&quot; are related to the depiction of the public ownership and common wife system of the guardian class. It must be said that the traditional translation of &quot;Ideology&quot; may not be too hard, but it may not be the general outline and original meaning of Plato&#39;s book. &quot;Imperial State&quot; (which is so alleged) was first written in ancient Greek by Plato. The original meaning of the Greek politea is actually the meaning of polity and political system, not &quot;ideal country&quot; or &quot;ideal country&quot;, and ancient The Greek &quot;political system, political system&quot; is not limited to the national category in modern vocabulary, but also the soul level applicable to individuals. Part of the Chinese translation of &quot;Ideology&quot; is the use of free translation (because the book does describe the construction of the best city-state), and part of it is influenced by the English translation. The English translation is basically translated as &quot;the Republic&quot;. Republic. In recent domestic scholars have repeatedly studied and thought carefully, and also gave another translation of &quot;king system&quot;. In my opinion, this kind of translation is closer to Plato&#39;s original book purpose than &quot;Utopia&quot; or &quot;National&quot;. The translation of &quot;king system&quot; can be more closely expressed or comprehensiveI absorbed most of the contents of this book, especially the punctuality of the ideal arrangement of the soul and the ideal arrangement of the city-state, implying that the perfection of Plato&#39;s own soul must be rational, and the bloody part is assisted. The realization of the desire part of the control implies the idea that Plato believes that the best city-state must be ruled by the philosopher who once climbed out of the cave. At the same time, it should be noted that Plato has a subtitle in every work in his school. Of course, it is not attached to Plato himself (at least not in his text). The posterior head of Plato Academy organizes Plato. In the book, according to the &quot;secret biography&quot; of Plato Academy, each work was given a subtitle, and the subtitle of &quot;Ideology&quot; was &quot;On Justice&quot;? It is true that Plato&#39;s own school evangelist grasps the book. . According to his own reading and thinking, the core clue of &quot;Ideology&quot; is still following the philosophical reflection of his teacher Socrates and the teachings of ancient Greek gods. Such philosophical reflection is so abstract, so high-level, so contains a lot of middle and lower layers. The problem is that Plato had to use a full ten volumes to operate and answer these questions, although we could not grasp whether he himself was satisfied with this answer. This so-called high-level question is actually very familiar, and it is the general outline of the classical philosophy of &quot;what kind of life is most worth living.&quot; The perfection of the soul is the state pursued by the philosopher, or perhaps the place where the philosopher may have come. However, witnessing the death of the teacher Socrates deeply touched him and inspired him to think about the conflict between the philosopher and the city-state. The philosopher is not by the city-state. What should the philosophers do, and how can the philosophical way of life take root in the city? Therefore, Plato has to complete a book to explain the philosophers and the philosophy of uplifting from the anxiety of a philosophical identity and the existence of the philosophical identity itself. Do not let the philosophy and its way of life fall, complete the philosopher&#39;s self-identity, and more It is to find a way out for the construction of the city state, and &quot;The Republic of China&quot; is one of the most important works. The &quot;Utopia&quot; is not a leisurely Plato, not a Plato by the simple poet, or even Plato, who is the image of the mass enlightened philosopher. In a larger sense, it is a kind of salvation of Plato under the deep crisis of philosophy. In this saving, Plato must first defend his teacher Socrates. Although he had already written the &quot;Defendment&quot;, this time the &quot;defense&quot; should be more comprehensive and more theoretical, and he must face those virtues. ofHomesickness clarifies the true image of Socrates. In the second step of this rescue, Plato wants to think about how the philosophers face the problem of the city-state. His mind calibrates the city-state with a higher than the philosophy of the city-state, to plan and even to modify the city-state. The city-state in his words is depicted by him. Already made, but he also thought: Why did the philosopher descend to the city-state, how can the philosophers partially give up the philosophical life. In order to establish an ideal city state, but also to defend the teacher, Plato found that he had to face the accusation of the poet. At that time, he began a full-scale battle, that is, the historic battle between the philosopher and the poet, philosophy and poetry, intermittently and intermittently. So far, in the &quot;Utopia&quot;, Plato has given violent refutation to the poets such as Homer and Hesiod. Plato said that the poet only knows how to imitate things, and even knows how to imitate the appearance of things. --------------------- To continue to add ------------------ Knowledge is limited, there is a &quot;ideal country&quot; &quot;There are many students who have researched and criticized",movie
720,"The action film fans are looking forward to Schwarzenegger and Stallone on the screen. I donâ€™t know how many years Iâ€™ve been looking forward to. The fans are eagerly eager to get to the middle-aged crisis, and the two actors are waiting for the governor to step down from the brave. The glimpse of the glimpse can only be regarded as a gimmick, far less than the classic opponents of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in &quot;The Pirates of Fire&quot;, the fans who went to the two old guys this time. Finally, it was a long-cherished wish. Even if I couldnâ€™t see the drama of the Terminatorâ€™s Rambo, I could see that the two heroes of the late heroes should be satisfied. The 47-year-old Schwarzenegger and the 46-year-old Stallone are also the old people who have buried the loess in the neck. Even if the fans believe that they are still alive and kicking, even if they are also dissatisfied with the old, after all, the years are not forgiving, no matter the sound and light painting How to pack, computer technology shooting skills, no matter how skillful, it is actually unable to cover up the facts of Lian quite old, even if the machine is also inevitable rust, let alone the flesh and blood of the people, let now run the 70 Stallone again Bo waved the old fist in the jungle and took the dagger to an enemy. It is estimated that there will be no audience to buy it. After a hard age, I learned to do everything. The film is not so much a fight. It is wit, from this point of view, it may make us face up to reality and look forward to it. The director obviously understands that it is impossible to make the big names of these two grandfathers from the beginning to the end. Therefore, the film does not focus on violent hard-hitting, but starts from the characters to win the plot and create a hero. I am greeted by the strong atmosphere to infect the audience. After all, if it is for the old brother to buy tickets into the theater, it will obviously not be too harsh. The film action is not too hot or even large, but I often see it. Novo and Stallone have a kind of pleasure for the audience, just like the old fists they have brought a lot of young and energetic, and the old bones that have not been exercised for many years are squeaky. Before the climax of the film, at the end of the two people, the prisoner was about to finish. When Schwarzenegger held the crane gun, he even cheered in the theater. It was like the ultimate &quot;I&#39;m back&quot; was really fulfilled, Stallone Then the pistol was taken under the helicopter to end the big BOSS. It was exactly the same as &quot;The First Blood&quot;, and there was nothing to regret about seeing the audience. The real contest between the two in the film is not really real.Guns, Stalloneâ€™s few old fists didnâ€™t make the former governor think. In fact, considering the position of two people in the history of the film, the audience is destined to see that the two have different winners and losers, plus todayâ€™s two Old age, instead of letting the two of them break their blood, it is not as good as the film as a friend. As for the Guan Gong and Qin Qiong, this is left to the audience fans as a forever talk. From time to time, the film director added a little bit of comedy and banter in the film to energize the cold and hard atmosphere of the whole movie. From time to time, let the two old people come out and sell it, which is rarely seen by the audience, and from the theater. The effect is quite good, especially Schwarzenegger&#39;s smile on the camera can be selected as the most cute moment of the annual movie. It doesn&#39;t matter if you can beat the audience&#39;s favor. It is obviously a good choice. The storm is not as good as wisdom. Take the director&#39;s heart like a mirror. &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is a movie that pleases the audience to dream of the audience. The audience who is watching the action movie may be disappointed. After all, this film is not comparable to &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;First Blood&quot;. Not to mention the addition of the two, but if you are a fan of the two and the action movie, watching this old film is a satisfying dream, but we want to see the Terminator war. Rambo is like a bloody scene, but the years are not forgiving. The &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is a bit of a dream that rounds up the audience&#39;s dreams or gives the audience a different dream.

In fact, the dialogue between the goddess and the goddess at the end of the story also laid the groundwork. This bridge is very personal. &quot;Every Monday, you have to say that I am not in the right position; I have always been eating at the same restaurant; the trip has never been in August...&quot; Well, the goddess started to move, you are going to be a Dalian string.

I am the most annoying purple color; the cup for brushing teeth should be placed on the second floor of the shelf, even a print can not be bad; toothpaste must be squeezed from bottom to top What happened to me from the middle? I am willing to squeeze from the middle; every Thursday, I will always be a noodle TV drama, a TV drama fried noodles; and, when you eat noodles, can you not lick this noodle? &quot;Well, you think of it. This is the complaint that Xu Lang has made to his wife who has lived together for a long time in Love Call Transfer.&quot; In fact, when I saw this, I was thinking about a problem? Why didnâ€™t you communicate? The goddess can spoil the husband, &quot;Lun family loves this position, you don&#39;t want this?? Son??

Like love, everything is good; if you don&#39;t love, everything is a reason. In short, I don&#39;t want everything to behave according to plan, I want to subvert, I want to surprise. I want to get in touch with the lion (Isn&#39;t this the rhythm of death? Did you forget the way you saw yourself when you saw the lion?)... Well, the goddess just wants to give up this decade of love. . I don&#39;t understand the constellation. If you know the constellation&#39;s friends, please help me with the sign of the goddess in the story. If you have a clear goal and a rigorous life, don&#39;t go to life that changes every moment. If the goddess is used to it? When the silk man has no place to live and there is a lion and a lion&#39;s life, when the change becomes always changing, who can guarantee this crazy and somewhat hysterical old French Will a woman think that he is not as steady and sturdy as a boyfriend who has been with him for ten years, and he is being taken to find the next true love? Say that I want to be stable, I don&#39;t want to worry about the lion, I don&#39;t want to sleep in a squatting room every day, I have to sleep in a big bed! ...and itâ€™s okay, who can guarantee? Many times, many people have forgotten the swearing in the process of swearing and forgetting, and accidentally let the time go empty. When &quot;Love Call Transfer&quot; ended, Xu Lang returned to the middle-aged woman who wanted to re-own &quot;Zi sweater, noodles, TV series&quot;However, she found that she had already become a treasure in the eyes of others, and she also praised the fried noodles of this middle-aged woman. Your passionate heart will return to calm one day. How to make you face so much calm life is your fundamental choice, so you don&#39;t have to toss it. Apply the statement of Evergrande Club, &quot;The champion is here.&quot; It is &quot;the peace is finally life.&quot; Go back and talk about this story. To put it bluntly, the story of the success of the silk goddess against the goddess is only the baton of the dreamer. It is nothing more than a mirror of the escapist. I remember someone commenting on the signature of the instant messaging tool, &quot;I want to be a singer, find a fourth man who loves me.&quot; Well, I want to hehe. Ok, in fact, the story of the goddess and the silk is just a joke. Although this film is very suitable for couples to watch together, please do not let your girlfriend travel alone.

722,"118 years ago, Count Dracula and his wife were seen as aliens, criticized and driven like class enemies. His wife was burned to death, but left a fire of life. At that time, people&#39;s actions might be really like &quot;Red Guards&quot;, hysterical, in the name of justice. People always promote tolerance on the one hand, but they spare no effort to exclude dissidents. After 118 years, Count Dracula also assessed the evil of mankind according to the impression at that time, so he did not let his daughter, the fire of his most precious life, go to the world to take risks. Yes, he has not been in contact with humans for more than 100 years. As everyone knows, the &quot;Red Guards&quot; at that time have now become new human beings who have watched American TV dramas and Japanese TV dramas. Are they really learning to be tolerant? I am afraid it is better to say that they are just used to regard tolerance as a fun game. In fact, Dracula, not a vampire, was accepted by humans, but Dracula himself was assimilated by human beings and became a part of them, not a different kind. He sings, dances disco, and talks about RAP. When you are surprised by the boldness of this idea, what really makes you laugh is not the humor of his vampire&#39;s identity and the behavior that does not match this behavior, but Once the class enemies will be assimilated by the soft power of culture. There was a plot in &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; that was born at the end of the Cold War era. Leo Saint Seiya Aeolia went to the base of the Bronze Saints, and singled out all the people who wanted to fight him. Although the United States has long been in the ideology of soft aggression against the Soviet Union, the Japanese who are prevalent in militarism still regard force as the main way to solve problems. However, if we look at the Elf Hotel, we know that 100 monster demons, perhaps not rivaling a small spy that humans &quot;sent&quot;. He carried a big parcel and went to the Elf Hotel. He had no time, no spells, and only taught his culture to the hotel with a single mouth. The elves were &quot;shaken&quot;. Of course, if this kind of soft cultural aggression is combined with a little lure and marriage, then the elf will not have a point of not surrendering. I remember that there is also a vampire in the Japanese animated film &quot;The Count of the Vampire&quot;, but he has been doing himself, although he has also experienced love with human beings. Therefore, the cultural view of Japanese animation is really different from American animation. Itâ€™s just that we are accepting a group of new human beings who are watching American TV dramas and Japanese TV dramas.Think more about it. In addition, this film may have been affected by the excessive number of &quot;Nemo&quot;, because they actually told the exact same story. That is, the mother died, and the father of the single-parent family became too care for the child and became a restriction on his free development. On the surface, it is the child who grew up from the age of zero. Actually, the father of an adult has been growing.",movie

Through the friends of six friends, you can meet the people you most want to know.&quot; &quot;There is a six-degree connection in the world. I met you through six people.&quot; &quot;If she is a North woman on the Internet, you don&#39;t need money for a lifetime.&quot; &quot;(Get the money back) Thank you, Sandworm Mom.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s called é²Ž, also called Couple fish. Because once they form a husband and wife, the public shackles are saved on the mother&#39;s back, and then they follow the form every day until they die.&quot;The Lord is the patron saint of Kinmen, and what he takes in his hand represents what he or she is. &quot;What do you take in love and longevity?&quot; &quot;Get the ball.&quot; &quot;&quot;why? &quot;There is a demand (ball) must. &quot;I miss you when I am sad, just like thinking about the sun in winter.&quot; I miss you when I am happy, just like thinking about the shade under the sun. &quot;I like you, but we can&#39;t be together, because I will be on the island of Kinmen for the rest of my life. I always have to carry my mother.&quot; &quot;I am not a guest, I will never let another husband and wife die.&quot; &quot;Sorry, Dad.&quot; But I have never been so free and happy. &quot;Akun&#39;s father was a Taiwanese. He came to Kinmen as a soldier. Then he met A Kwan, and A Kwan was married after the two married. Later, A Kuan&#39;s father went to Taiwan and never returned. Ah Kuan&#39;s mother collapsed and went crazy. A Kuan generally works while taking care of his mother. For Bai Fumei like Chen Wenqing, A Kuan feels that since she can&#39;t stand together, how can she like her, Xiaoqing is just a passer-by to Kinmen. So A Kuan to Xiao Qing The show of love is dodging, and the sandworm is used as a shield. But in fact, Xiaoqing sacrificed his life in order to love him. The plot is very clichÃ©, the tragedy of the youth pure love drama, look good, don&#39;t hold the fantasy. Lin Yixin is very beautiful, but it feels a bit The traces of artificiality are not natural enough, and the acting skills are a little bit worse, but they are versatile and can play the piano to play the violin. The songs in the film also sing well. Lin Meixiuâ€™s aunt is a bright spot, and all the words are happy. The sandworm is destined for tragedy. In Bai Fumei&#39;s eyes, richness is not an advantage, and Gao Shuai is more important. The two sections of the conflict between the young and the young people of the electric beads are better to be deleted and not coordinated with the film. The small island of Kinmen The light is beautiful, beach, waves, farmland, green space, tunnel, B&amp;B, Jincheng, Fengshiye, Dashenggong, suitable for urban people to slow down and relax. &quot;Don&#39;t think that your environment is not good, you can&#39;t worry about loving one.&quot; people.

724,"In 1959, at the William Daws Elementary School in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA, the school was about to celebrate its anniversary, and the idea put forward by the little girl Lucin Amberley (Lara Robinson) was adopted by the principal. On the day of the celebration, the students will draw their own visions of the future and concentrate them in the metal time capsule to bury them underground, ready to reopen 50 years later. On Lucinda&#39;s drawing paper, she was full of numbers. On the evening of the school day, the teacher found the missing Lucinda in the closet of the gymnasium. Lucinda used nails to grab the door like an animal and left a string of blood on the door. In 2009, William Das Elementary School once again ushered in the school day, and was buried in the underground for 50 years to see the day. The little boy Keller (Chandler Canterbury) received a letter from Lucinda, and the entire page was covered with irregular numbers of papers for Kellerâ€™s father, John (Nicholas Cage, Nicolas Cage), who teaches astrophysics at MIT. Interested, he accidentally discovered that 911012996 of them represented 2,996 lost lives on the 9/11/01 anniversary. He continued to study and found that the numbers are all accurate predictions of the date, death toll, and GPS latitude and longitude coordinates of major global disasters. The last three sets of numbers have not yet arrived. John wants to stop but is unable to return to heaven. He witnessed the crash and the subway derailed and rushed onto the platform. In order to crack the last EE in the last set of numbers, John found Lucina&#39;s daughter, Diana, and learned that Lucinda had passed away a few years ago. In the former residence of Lucinda, John found the back of the bed with EE on behalf of Everyone Else, everyone. In the cottage, Lucinda saw a painting that was often seen during her lifetime. Dianaâ€™s daughter Abby said that one of them was the sun. The blood word on the door panel of the basement of the William Daws Elementary School is the GPS latitude and longitude coordinates of the last disaster. The original catastrophe was the super sun ray, which would kill every living thing on Earth. Since Keller received the letter from Lucinda, there was always a group of black people who were watching them in the distance, and only Taylor could hear what the black man whispered in his head. Abby can also hear the voices of these whispers. It turns out that these whispers have the ability to predict, and the number of Lucinda before them told her. The whisperers left the earth to take refuge with people and animals who could hear their voices. John came to his parentsâ€™ home and hugged with his parents and sister.Together to welcome the end of the world. The earth was destroyed, and Taylor and Abby each came to the new planet with a rabbit. &quot;Only those who can hear the call can leave the Earth to take refuge with them.&quot; The revelation of the suspense mystery made the film from a suspense thriller into a sci-fi disaster film, with religious colors. These whispers who can pass the sound into the mouth and shoot in the mouth are said to be aliens, and more to say, angels of God. The spaceship they are riding is a &quot;holy instrument&quot;, and the two children are Adam and Eve. In the Garden of Eden, rush to the tree of life. The most important thing is that in the living room of Lucinda, the Bible is placed on the bedside table.",movie
725,"Paranoid love, paranoid hate, and the dream of a golden cake are also paranoid. At first glance, this drama knows that those who are actually acting are doing it, not those who are being held. At the beginning, I strongly recommend it, and I often look at the discussion in the group and increase my popularity. Later, some people said that TVB can only watch ten episodes now, and then supplement it with their own brains. The previous story is that the younger brother is starting a business in Macao. The biggest obstacle is his father, there are many warm and funny scenes, the love relationship with Aying, small and simple, very warm, developing new products, developing new sales, resisting the underworld, how Tragic and strong, at the beginning, it has created a good image that is very clever, very aura, honest, and constantly overcome difficulties in frustration. On the one hand, my brother is constantly fighting for the upper position, except for the bravery of the police, the investment vision, the hatred of the father, and the love of the goddess. The play is over. We have seen the fate of Samâ€™s tragedy, the rough road, and only the last few episodes, he has already died two times. Some people say that he is killing the people he loves. In the middle of the period, the fast mirror was put up, and the past one was turned over. I went to Hong Kong from the letter and the British. When I heard that Rachel didn&#39;t accompany them, I lost my mind and rushed back to Macau. This is a sign. I don&#39;t know when I don&#39;t love it, ten years, nothing more. A lover who has worked together for a decade and has been acquainted with each other can&#39;t resist the &quot;goddess&quot; who are arrogant in the distance. Blinking his eyes, blinking and dragons squatting, blinking eyes, having a child, blinking abortion, blinking to get married, blinking and not getting married. I thought they were so scattered, but fortunately not. On my brother&#39;s side, this episode is fighting SARS. It is good to turn over the episodes and it will be fine. Later, it became a bad thing for everyone to count down Sam, and the number was too strong. No one thought that he was wrong. In addition to his fate, Sam&#39;s tragedy, in addition to his own perceived personality, and the distrust of his loved ones, in the final ending, Zhong Jiaxin was &quot;disappointed with him&quot;, and the police immediately led him to shoot. If the last brother is still good, he trusts his brother. And it has been Mandy who has always trusted Sam. It has changed my hate for this actor. In that scene, Sam wants to kill Kim Sir. She raised her hand and abandoned the picture. She was very moved. Originally, he was in jail, and it was nearing the end. This kind of ending would not be as hearty as what we actually saw. The actual ending would have shaped Samâ€™s life as such a strong and strong character. This ending really makes people like this role. If you really want to count SamThe wrong thing is to start with Fabio kiss, not forgiven drunk and get into bed, sheltering Jiang Yong to kill. And if you don&#39;t comment on these things, there is nothing wrong with it. As he said, he has already controlled very well. Including the endings, I only wanted to live in the lowest level of the underworld, and finally the sense of justice broke out. I really sincerely admire that he can still have such a right and wrong after many tortures of fate. After two deaths, Rachel was just such an understatement. He also loved her paranoidly. I also fantasized that he had a love and a good voice in the prison after the suicide. The fate of the fate has turned for 30 years, life is in a hurry, so there is a feeling of passing passengers, some people who are very important in a certain period of the protagonist, sometimes disappeared, so that the viewers are paralyzed.",movie
726,"For 20 years, Stallone and Schwarzenegger teamed up, destined to be the most exciting thing for action fans, but in the era of &quot;Avatar&quot; &quot;Avengers&quot;, it is like a nostalgic work of hardcore action fans. In the past, in addition to Japanâ€™s Konami company, who used the prototypes of two Hollywood activist superstars in 1987, the horizontal version of the reel action shooting game Contra was launched, and the blue pants Bill Enze and the red pants Lansbyen fought side by side. The live version of &quot;Contra&quot; has never been fit. Fortunately, the &quot;Death Squad&quot;, which was the mainstay of the 80s gunpowder, set off a box office fever, which made Stallone and Arnold revitalize their second spring career. This led to the two men continuing to join forces in &quot;Golden Shelling.&quot; This time, the &quot;Contra&quot; combination not only grinds their teeth together, but also abandons the simple and rude deaths and changes to the high-tech jailbreak. A prison security expert who lives on jailbreak does not want to be trapped in a terror prison that is not leaking. The buddies have tried their best to escape from the prison and become the main clue. In the cage, Stallone incarcerated the incarnation of the prisoner&#39;s Schwarzenegger, trying to fight with the devil&#39;s prisoner James Cavieze, and finally escaped from birth. The plot setting of &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; has seen too many people in Hollywood commercials, and they are clearly a stereotype. But the two toughest men who used to be in the golden age of Hollywood action films also tried to hit the market with ups and downs of high IQ escapes. The breakout of this endangered species can only surprise the action fans of the 1990s, I am afraid it can only be verified. The old saying? The years are killing the knife. Stallone&#39;s Ray Breslin, who lives on jailbreak, has a calm and confident expression, and still has a general style. Although he has been playing for so many years, the flesh has collapsed so badly that there is no such youth as Rambo, but the old man is trying to support the situation by &quot;taking a good hand&quot;. The old tile is not only full of vicissitudes of white hair, but also the wrinkles on the face need to be covered by a beard. This time it has become the supporting role of Stallone, but the sale of Meng and German attracts the attention of the prison chief, and the funny is extremely in place. At the end, he also focused on machine guns sweeping a large piece, as if the &quot;Terminator&quot; T-800 soul possessed. What James Kavize wants to do is to interrogate and bully the two, highlighting the bad BOSS style. In the details of the plot, it is clear that there is a certain amount of effort. For example, Stallone started with a small knife, slammed the fire, pressed the password, and pretended to be a firefighter, and escaped from the federal prison. If he had just placed a tracker on his body, the person who attacked him relied on the instrument to track the GPS. Dig out to destroy, roadIt also killed other criminals and made people shudder; there was another prison that made the tempered glass, and the steel bars were everywhere, making people look like &quot;the wings are difficult to fly.&quot; The Arab bald who likes the Koran and the prison doctor who has a conscience have made some preparations. The two accomplices gave the two brothers a chance to escape. In addition, Stallone escaped from the forbidden room floor, stole iron and needle tubes to make instruments, and calculated the fine latitude, and then tried to ventilate the letter. These subtle details are definitely different from the hard work of the &quot;Death Squad&quot; series, which seems to show you &quot; &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is going to take the high-tech high-tech route, but the loopholes are also quite a lot. Doctors may be so easy to report? Arnold is the person the prison director is looking for.... These can&#39;t be deduced. Although the film is a man&#39;s play, but still trying to show a warm side, the hero actor Lei? Breslin has served as a prosecutor, the prisoner retaliates his wife and children&#39;s painful experience, let him choose dry security experts, and always draw small people back The home&#39;s stick figures show a sense of vicissitudes. Born in 1987, &quot;Contra&quot; is now only 26 years old. I did not expect the unity of the two super-tough guys, but it is already sixty-six or seven years old. At that time, &quot;Lambo&quot; and &quot;Terminator&quot; were obviously not so beaten now. The &quot;Contra&quot; combination can only rely on the prison to make tricks, engage in conspiracy, engage in subversion, and then use guns to sweep the bad guys and finally escape. The &quot;Underwater Eight Passes&quot; on the screen of &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is obviously a kind of easy-to-follow shooting method. Looking at the &quot;Contra&quot; combination in front of the wits, behind relying on violent drama to win, like to be an &quot;eight-bit game machine&quot; dream. &quot;Golden Shelling&quot; is said to be worse than expected at the box office in North America. Nowadays, children are more likely to watch &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Hunger Games&quot; and &quot;Thai?&quot;, but this is a good fan of this kind of fan action movie.",movie

728,"Originally, the book written by Koreans should be very unsuitable for China&#39;s situation, but in fact, it is the same for money countries. Rich people will always have common points and have places worth learning. 1. Savings and investment are efficient and parallel. Opinion: not saving, it is definitely not a rich man; saving is not a virtue, but a means; working hard to make money is not for consumption but for investment; savings is to keep, investment is attack; time is money; savings and investment must be early; Poverty is worse than trying to get rich. 2. Borrowing must be for investment. There are two kinds of people in the world, one is the one who lets the money roll up flexibly, and the other is the one who is invisibly throwing away the money by the former. The rich are the ones who can make money roll up flexibly. Viewpoint: Want to buy a house, loan it; people who only want to pay debts can not become rich; use debt to create more income; debt is also an asset. (Use long-term loans to increase cash flow, but no credit card) 3. Even if the sky falls, you must keep the cost. One of the investment principles must not lose the cost; the second principle of investment must adhere to principle one. Opinion: Being able to keep the cost is to make money; losing the cost means losing everything; no risk and no gain. (The most important thing is to keep the principal, learn to manage risk, and seek income on a stable basis. Buffettâ€™s annual income is 26%, but never lost.) 4. The secret of compound investment. Compound interest investment is a â€œstepping stoneâ€ for the rich. Opinion: Time is money; use compound investment; spend money to earn &quot;time&quot;; &quot;72&quot; rule to achieve rich. (Time can be used to extract the effect of compound interest) 5. rely on &quot;common sense&quot; to speculate stocks. Looking for the same in change, this is the &quot;common sense&quot; that can make big money. Opinion: &quot;The power of common sense&quot; leads successful investment; stocks and speculation in real estate have the same effect; organically combine diversified investment with concentrated investment; and blue-chip stocks must be held for a long time. (Use common sense to stocks, such as consumer goods, even if the social depression will be used, but the IT industry tends to fluctuate) 6. The mystery of the speculation fund. Opinion: enthusiasm and time are the catalyst for direct investment success; investors seeking stability should make indirect investment; can not blindly believe in the products recommended by fund agents, carefully look at the past performance of fund products rather than the current performance, not Stubbornly choose fund products whose yields exceed the average rate of return. Consider long-term investment, do not choose bonds and stock hybrid funds, and should choose a simple stock fund. Don&#39;t look at the mountain. 7. Do good to good people and evil to wicked people. In addition to strength, you still need the bottomThe card is the password that leads to success. 8. It is not the survival of the fittest, but the survival of the strong. Talented people are the dominators of this world; when appropriate, they win with &quot;fraud&quot;; arm themselves with the theory of the strong. 9. Chasing success. Gaining knowledge from a place that is visible, and gaining wisdom from an invisible place, such a person has the qualification to become a rich person. Viewpoint: Constantly chasing wealth; constantly learning to invest in financial management; the book has its own gold house. 10. Take the book as a companion. The new generation of rich people are all study mad. Don&#39;t make excuses to say that you don&#39;t have time to study. 11. Manage your marriage with your heart. To become a rich person, you must marry someone you love; marital happiness is the foundation of success. 12. Accumulate connections. No matter who you are, you can&#39;t be rich without your own strength. Viewpoint: The power of connections; the connections need to be carefully managed. 13. &quot;Remove&quot; competitors.

Don&#39;t hesitate to pay if you need it, but even if you do, you must make reasonable spending. Opinion: It is not because of vain but because of the need; when it is used, it is never blame; for the pursuit of reasonable consumption; saving is completely different from åå•¬. 15. The first impression determines success or failure. Although we do not have the right to choose the face that God has given us, we have the right to modify our appearance. Opinion: Wear is the key to opening the door of wealth; how to wear the mature beauty of traditional suits; how to choose a suit that fits; how to wear shirts for successful people; the choice of tie and the method; the shoes can reflect a person&#39;s taste. 16. Information is wealth. Even if you have the information, you can&#39;t make big money without the foresight and determination of the information. 17. Live to learn old.

The lion squats in a pair of eyes that sleep and sleep, quietly squatting in the grass, observing the surroundings, as long as there is a target of prey, the arrow will generally rush. Investment should be like this. Opinion: Bidding is an investment game that uses the mind to make money. The five advantages of bidding, you can buy real estate at a much lower price than the market price through bidding; the bidding process is simple and safe, and even novices who donâ€™t know much about bidding can participate; using bidding can avoid Open the government&#39;s various real estate policies; the real estate auctioned, even in the economic downturn, can get good returns; as a real estate target, in addition to the Asian economic crisis, South Korea&#39;s real estate has never let The investors are disappointed. Looking for the blue ocean of the investment market; bidding once a year is enough. 21. Master foreign languages â€‹â€‹and become world people. Itâ€™s better to see the best, and the best way to broaden your horizons is to travel. In order to cultivate a business vision and perform, the younger the better. Another effective way to cultivate an international vision is to regularly read foreign business magazines. For example, Business Week, Fortune Man, Forbes, etc. International etiquette is as important in business communication as superb foreign language ability.",movie
729,"Before watching this movie, please circulate in your heart, &quot;This is not a movie, it is the main melody promo...&quot; Keeping this mentality will make you not too demanding in the process of watching movies. Under the support of the main melody of Weiguang Zhengguang, the supporting actors led by Liu Qingyun and Louis Koo perfectly explain what is the NPC template state... The so-called NPC, the official interpretation is the &quot;non-player character&quot; in the game, but now more common Interpretation refers to those Facebook characters who have a weak sense of existence and no sense of substitution. For example, an ordinary blacksmith, the only role is to repair equipment or buy and sell weapons, at most, to send you a task that repeats hundreds of times on top of the sky, without too complicated character background and emotions. In this movie, whether it is exquisite acting, Liu Qingyun and Gu Tianle who are good at character shaping, or those small names who can&#39;t name them, are basically swaying on this level. China&#39;s good labor model Liu Qingyun: This role belongs to the variant of the traditional Weiguang positive character. It pays more attention to rules and responsibilities than human nature. Fortunately, there is still a change and compromise in the end.

In fact, although this kind of character lacks human touch, it is still worthy of respect, but it is typical of a publicity tree that is typical of a big fan, but it is not necessary. Life winner Gu Tianle: Relatively speaking, this character is the king of the NPC.

Since it is a disaster film, it must be dead, but a good person can&#39;t die too much. What should I do? Ok, three of them are hard... In fact, as a disaster film with no precedent in China, itâ€™s still a good thing to say. Itâ€™s a pity that the directorâ€™s heart is a little bigger. So many characters want to be all over the film in less than two hours. The final result must be that the characters are not perfect.

The fact is that it is so clever that Japanâ€™s Konami company used the prototypes of two Hollywood activist stars Stallone and Schwarzenegger as early as 1987 to launch the horizontal scroll action shooting game Contra, and buried our dreams for our superstars. Under such a deep foreshadowing. Stallone and Schwarzeneggerâ€™s joint fear is indispensable for the death squad.

There are pets in the family. Of course, I am interested in Dai Kejiâ€™s study of animal behavior in the United States. It is a matter of many years ago, so now there is a consensus on the domestication method of loving and encouraging positive guidance. In fact, this book was published in Taiwan by Dai Keiji many years ago. Nowadays, because of its popularity in the Mainland, it has been repackaged and listed on the mainland market. The content has not been adjusted. Therefore, after more than a decade, I feel that there is nothing new. The concept of a person who has a large number of scientific dog-raising has been consistent with the views in the book, and books such as dogs and minds are more important than this book. It is much more complete and more scientific; the second is about the treatment of specific situations.

732,"Teacher Qin Huiâ€™s traditional ten theory opened a window to my view of Chinese history. Because I donâ€™t know enough about history, I have never considered these issues in depth. After reading it, I was particularly inspired. To sum up, the most important and most impressive views are three: First, China has never been a small community society, it has always been subject to the control of the big community, that is, the royal power is centralized; second, it has always been the Confucianism in Chinese history. The third is that Taoism is the glue of Confucianism and Law. With the complementarity of Confucianism and Taoism and the complementarity of the Fa, the original values â€‹â€‹of Confucianism and law are magically perfectly combined. Some time ago, I just watched the reversal of the red wheel by Teacher Jin Yan. Nowadays, reading the traditional ten theory is also worthy of complement each other. There are particularly sensational passages in the excerpts: 1. The pre-Qin legalists openly advocated the idea of â€‹â€‹&quot;national wealth and poverty&quot; as the rule of the country. ... only let them be poor will depend on the country! 2. The reason why China did not develop a modern economy, and even the dynasty dynasty was prevented from collapsing, not because the &quot;merger&quot; was not enough or excessively excessive, not because the country was too &quot;promising&quot; or too &quot;inaction&quot;. Not even because of the traditional â€œlaissez-faireâ€ or too much â€œstate interventionâ€. The fundamental problem is that the traditional economic process does not establish â€œprocess justiceâ€, which is necessary to establish a modern economy (a regulated market economy). The traditional economy did not follow the rule that â€œinitial property is innocent, and wealth accumulation afterwards is realized through its own transactionsâ€. 3. The speed of reform is faster or slower. It is a problem in one step or step by step. This is certainly a problem. But more importantly, the shackles of getting rid of the old system should be synchronized with the protection of the old system. Some people can&#39;t be allowed to get rid of the bond but still enjoy the protection. Some people lose their protection but are still bound. The former monopolizes the opportunity. The latter bears the risk, the former enjoys the â€œoutcomeâ€ and the latter pays the â€œcostâ€. 4. The grass-roots organizations under the control of the traditional imperial villages can do things as they are, not necessarily the moral image of the people. 5. It is very difficult for traditional China to have the disadvantage of being a &quot;lord&quot; in the true sense. The &quot;owner&quot; in Chinese history is either a &quot;state broker&quot; or a government support. This form of &quot;the disadvantage of the owner&quot; is essentially the same as the corruption of the government. It is not a simple one. &quot;Owner&quot; issue. Either the &quot;owner&quot; as a self-governing force that can balance the omnipotent state plays the role of &quot;protective brokerage&quot;. This kind of owner will naturally have both advantages and disadvantages, but it is more common than the abuse of the omnipotent state.It is secondary. 6. The prohibition of the &quot;egalitarianism&quot; under the control of the imperial power of the people is actually the biggest injustice, that is, Huang Zongâ€™s &quot;following my greatness as the grandfather of the world.&quot; 7. The Qin Dynasty, with a population of only 20 million and a unity of only 10 years, can build the Great Wall, the Wuling Mountains, the Zhichi Road, and the huge Xufu fleet. The construction of the First Emperor Mausoleum and the Afang Palace is also a great project. It is this kind of large community that relies on the control of the households, which is unimaginable in the Middle Ages. 8. In a sense, the third sector in the West is engaged in a grand experiment, and the success of the Western â€œpostmodernâ€ civilization can be further improved, that is, unfortunately, it is â€œa harmless Utopiaâ€. Nor will it affect the basic achievements that Western civil society has achieved. The third sector in China bears a heavy mission. It is actually the same fate as the modernization of the other two &quot;departments&quot;, namely, the construction of democratic politics and market economy. 9. The â€œgovernment failureâ€ and â€œmarket failureâ€ faced by China and the third sector of many developing countries are very different. In the history of China, there is a problem of insufficient restraint function and insufficient protection function under the big community standard. Although the old system before the reform was called â€œbig pot riceâ€, the level of social security is actually very low, especially the majority of the population. The peasants did not enjoy any protection while being severely restrained by the old system. This is the only reason why Chinese farmers can initiate reforms. China&#39;s &quot;market failure&quot; is not a manifestation of the logical flaws of the market mechanism itself, but the result of power distortions in the market. Therefore, the problems faced by the third sector of China and the West are obviously different. That is to say, in the same criticism of state behavior, in developed countries, state intervention is a dilemma of choice between fairness and efficiency. The left (social democrats) require state intervention to maintain fairness, while the right (conservatives) believe that state intervention Impeding efficiency, but they will not blame state intervention for the accumulation of power. 10. On the issue of governance, the ruling thoughts of Confucianism and Buddhism are almost two extremes. That is to say, Confucianism is based on the theory of sexual goodness, based on the principle of ethical centralism, and advocates superior administrative justice. The legalist view of the rule of law is based on the theory of sexual evils, based on the principle of power-centrism, and advocates administrative security first. 11. Confucianism attaches importance to moral cultivation and is conducive to the bureaucratic conduct and self-discipline, but the lack of institutional precautions and small circle tendencies will contribute to the shortcomings. The neglect of administrative justice and the exclusion of clean stream by legalists is an important source of corruption, but it is decentralizingThe system design of checks and balances, examination system, and avoidance system has a certain preventive effect on official maladministration. In fact, in the two thousand years of imperial China, from the Qin to Qing dynasty, the mainstream of Chinaâ€™s traditional rule of governance is â€œthe Confucianism and the Lawâ€, that is, the Confucian politics, the legalist politics, and the sexual good theory. It is the theory of sexual evil; it is about four-dimensional and eight virtues, playing with &quot;the magic power&quot;; the ethical centralism on paper, and the power centralism in behavior. Just from the game of power checks and balances in the &quot;sexual evil theory&quot;, China and the modern West not only seem to have some superficial similarities, but it can even be said that China far exceeds the West. Even more than modern Western politics emphasizes the division of power (if you do not consider the maintenance of monarchy or the maintenance of civil rights, the essential difference is only formally).",movie
733,"Amount, that, I really didn&#39;t mean to watch this film. Because I was looking for your sister on the sofa at that time, I was very excited, and this movie appeared on the TV inexplicably, because I vaguely remember that Tencent Youkuâ€™s recent movie was also on the line, so I didnâ€™t turn it over, and I saw it all the way. Come down. I am too lazy to say one by one. In short, when the most horrible time is, the director wants to let the audience see the reaction of the blind man climbing out of the TV. I am in a movie with a strange atmosphere and a thrilling soundtrack. I can&#39;t help but laugh and laugh, I can&#39;t help it. This egg is also outrageous. ! I hope that the director understands that the horror film is to grasp the person psychologically, instead of splashing blood for sensory stimulation. In addition, don&#39;t talk about horror movies, but if you have a movie, you have to have a story and a plot. There is a script that can be said to be true. This is not an excessive requirement.

735,"A while ago, there was a lively and extraordinary post in the watercress. It was about how a bear child would squander precious hand-made and high-priced headphones when he was visiting relatives and friends, and he was not rude with the bears and children. Itâ€™s not a story of a broken toy. The heroic story of the protagonist shed tears, revealing the helplessness of the bear child and the helplessness of the son. Before this post, I also read another story that has not yet been tested. It tells the story of how the landlord is teased by the bear child, how the parents are short-sighted, and finally the heart and soul of the heart attack, and the small dispute has soared to the dance. The realm of the martial arts of the guns, at the end of the landlord issued a &quot;sense to see later.&quot; The media of good things have set off the topic and pushed the waves in the tongue. This has led to a large number of netizens who have sprung the bears they have met and now, and they have been so busy for a while... until a sunny day, Liâ€™s family is screaming, and the market is paradoxical. Only then turned the gun head and stared at this is the most powerful bear child in history. Don&#39;t look at the thickening of &quot;The Gate of the Qing&quot;, in fact, the story inside is quite simple. To put it bluntly, a female teacher deals with a full range of bear children in a very evil way. In order to sell money, the publishing house resisted two flags on the waist as a reference for the book. One is &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and the other is &quot;The Confession&quot;. After reading the book carefully, Fang Jue is deeply misled. The &quot;Great Escape&quot; is a humanity experiment that puts the group in an extremely closed environment, and the problems discussed in &quot;The Gate of Elimination&quot; are fundamentally far-reaching. If you really want to analogy, I personally think that &quot;The Gate of Elimination&quot; is more like a hybrid of &quot;confession&quot; and &quot;the teaching of evil&quot; (Lianshi classroom). Black Wuyang, who debuted as a cartoonist, has a sharp pen, and each line of compact text has a full picture. A middle-aged female teacher who is alone, after the mourning of a woman, has a great understanding and sees through her life. After careful planning, the kidnapping was carried out in the taught class one day before graduation. However, Heiwuyang did not grind like a singer, and used a half-man&#39;s rhythm and soft torture to punish the students. The opening is blood, and every page has dead people. It is like the lotus of the &quot;Evil&quot;. The classroom in &quot;confession&quot;. Lianshi, who is under the slogan of You Zhiyou, dedicates the reverse beauty with extremely evil crimes. And Hei Wuyang must give Ayazi a reason?? That is to educate bear children. Only the ending is the same as the title of &quot;The Gate of the Elimination&quot;. This &quot;education&quot; is not to lose the chalk head, not to touch the head of the landlord, or to go home to write a review, almost everyoneThey were all terminated in an instant by cutting bloody throats and headshots. Such works, which reflect on the exploration of the &quot;Youth Law&quot; hat, almost invariably try to attract the reader&#39;s attention through the painstaking means of violence. Unfortunately, most of them have succeeded. While refracting the reality, the author exaggerates the social contradictions, but the sorrows that are more or less revealed in his writings are the inevitable outcome of the mutual restraint between the legal system, morality and humanity. Human beings born under emotional entanglement can never be absolutely restrained in the rational text. Now it will not work, and it will not work in the future. As for whether the author has shouted &quot;will save the child&quot;, I don&#39;t think so. Indeed, in the passage of the ransom in &quot;The Gate of the Clearance&quot;, Hei Wuyang criticized the parents who were insensitive by the mouth of Ayako, but the taste of sympathy was also mixed. At the end of &quot;The Shield of Straw&quot;, Qingmao Guoxiu was sincere and repented to the judge. &quot;I knew that I must die, and I would kill a few more.&quot; The human nature is good or the human nature is evil. Hei Wuyang has no ability to explain in the book and does not want to explain. Aside from these seemingly high-end humanity, law, and moral arbitrage, &quot;The Gate of Elimination&quot; is definitely a fast-paced thriller novel, which makes people unknowingly follow the rhythm of the author, especially at the end of the book. Reversing the foreshadowing, it is surprising, but also buried the thoughts of waiting for the sequel. In this &quot;life plan, dead random&quot; era, I close the book, I really want to bow to the south and sing a promise? In addition to thanking the roommates for not killing, I also want to thank you when I was a bear child. The menâ€™s hands are merciful. Suddenly, I suddenly realized that thousands of years ago when Confucius was a teacher, he said that &quot;only women and villains are difficult to raise.&quot; Is this little person referring to bear children? According to historical records, the Confucius disciple is three thousand, and the famous surname is only seventy. Others are all...",movie
736,"Today&#39;s reasoning has entered a dead end. Behind the high mountains and the classics of the predecessors, a group of reasoning writers were born and died in the &quot;secret room&quot; built by their peers. Just like the same move against the Saints, the readers are full of books, and the skills of the singers have been contested by Bronze Xiaoqiang, and the search of the Internet era is everywhere. It belongs to the golden age of Gao Mubinguangâ€™s predecessors.

So, do you still have to write in the Chamber of Secrets and Bengue? Of course, you have to write, but you can&#39;t write according to the traditional routine. There is a youth TV series called &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; in the United States. There are a number of queens, tea pots, and high-sounding men. This drama is shot in the sixth season. The relationship between men and women has been arranged in numbers such as AB, CD, AC, and BD. Over and over again, I can&#39;t edit it quickly. Obviously, the Aoi eagle realized the truth from it, and the Benguemi room has not yet reached the end of the exhaustion. Since the deceased can die, the murderer can die, the police can die... How can the detective not die? Thus, the book &quot;Detectives are dead when they come up&quot; was born. The publisher intends to make a big ticket with this gimmick, and the result is almost not broken. The readers with bad eyes and curiosity have found out that they have been turned to dozens of pages. The so-called detective Miao Mu Sunrise male is still on the paper, there is no idea of â€‹â€‹going to death; and then it goes down to the hundred pages. When the detective died, it was dead, but in the form of ghosts he seemed to be more free from the flesh... The author was a liar. I think so. This set of road Nishizawa has been playing for a long time. The so-called sci-fi reasoning is the life-saving straw that the reasoning writer caught when he broke out in the dead end, and re-examined the actual murder case by taking the observation angle of traditional physical constraints. If you think so, you are right. The author is indeed a liar and has cheated you more than once. Aoiâ€™s &quot;Detectives are coming up and died&quot; tells the story of a super unlucky detective, Miaomu Sunrise, who, after his unfortunate death, tried to solve the crime in a ghostly form. Regardless of the title of the book or the final outcome, the original intention of Aoiâ€™s writing is anti-reasoning. When the detective is dead, there is no way to solve the case, and there is no way to solve the case. However, the author did not say that the ghost detective (G in the book) could not solve the case, and the practice of changing the soup without changing the medicine was indeed suspected of fraud. This ghost-like detective like a loverUntil the protagonists in the mountain are dead, they will get the truth through the ghost mouths reported in succession. Detectives may not necessarily have to solve the case, and everyone has been fooled. It was not until the old story about the legacy dispute and the bloody debts finally came to an end that I understood the honesty behind the authorâ€™s blackmail.",movie

741,"The drama &quot;Golden Jade Manchu&quot;, which was launched in the background of the century-old enterprise Jin Yutang, is in full swing in Zhejiang TV station. One is the resentment of the big family around the property competition, and the other is the mystery of the two heroines of Zhang Hanyan and Liu Caifan. Zhang Hanyan Wang Yinan Yin Yin Yang&#39;s emotional entanglement, the play with a clear line of dark lines emotional line firmly grasp the audience, people can not stop. The giants are one of the best types of productions that have always been known for their masterpieces. The &quot;Jade Jade Manchu&quot; is written from the gold medalwriters, to the aftermath of Hu Xinger, the popular red star Mu Tingting, the sister flowers in the play, and then to the old bones. The supporting role selection and the high-end atmosphere scene design all show their determination to use this drama to set a new benchmark for the giant screen in the mainland. From the perspective of the broadcast, &quot;Jinyu Mantang&quot; has indeed opened up a new development trend for domestic urban emotional drama. The play avoids the characteristics of the difficult characters that are often caused by the complicated characters of the giants. The opening ceremony uses the Jin Yutang Centennial Celebration to make a concise explanation of many characters, and also uses several small conflicts. The story structure of the whole drama was paved with the meaning of the opening ceremony of the &quot;Godfather&quot; wedding. Then the drama cleverly shifted the focus of the plot from the giants to the crack of the two sisters&#39; mystery, which enriched the audience. The competition for property and other old dramas has also added a sense of freshness that can burn the audience&#39;s pursuit of drama. Not long ago, South Korea&#39;s first TV series &quot;Her Myth&quot; tells the story of identity loss. The arrangement of &quot;Golden Jade Manchu&quot; is a two-pronged arrangement. . Now the story is about halfway through, Zhang Hanyan&#39;s mother knows the truth but does not say that Han Yan&#39;s biological mother saw that she always has an inexplicable intimacy, and this moment of enthusiasm and entanglement is the most irritating. The characters of Zhang Hanyan and Liu Caifan are more and more three-dimensional. They are not simple black-and-white sister flowers, a kindness in the end, a bad thing to do, but all have their own unique humanity. The courage and independence beyond Han Yan is more in line with modern people. The aesthetic trend, the fear of not getting the parents&#39; true love and fear of the East Window incident can lead to resonance and substitution. Many viewers also expressed their hatred for self-serving roles such as Han Yan&#39;s foster mother. Perhaps this is the sagacity of the drama. There is no such thing as today&#39;s hateful itch, how can the truth be revealed when the truth is revealed. Successfully created the drama tension between the sisters of the package, and Hu Xinger and Mu Tingtingâ€™s excellent interpretations are of course indispensable. Although Hu Xingâ€™s performance is after Hong Kong, the performance in the play has no sense of unity and freshness.The bright temperament makes people shine. An ordinary girl does not worship gold, does not be kitsch, and will eventually win a beautiful future with her own efforts. Hu Xing&#39;s upright and positive performance will bring the positive energy of positive and inspiration to the extreme. The new popular actress Mu Tingting uses a similar villain role to launch new challenges to her acting career. It is no longer the fairy who is always open in &quot;Happiness&quot;, but a giant who is deeply guilty of inner pain. This change has also been recognized by her fans. The story of the first half of the &quot;Golden Jade Manchu&quot; is closely linked, and the escalating drama conflict is perfect, but it is expected that the drama will also turn into the rhythm of child abuse, and the audience will watch the cry while watching. Until the end of the final period, I still remember the ending I wanted. Perhaps this is the greatest charm of a good show.",movie

Putting it in the drama, there is no doubt a complete disaster. Fortunately, this is a crazy comedy that ignores logic. It is the stream of &quot;Stupid Show&quot;, focusing on the visual jokes of the past and forgetting the absence of the plot. For 90 minutes of pleasure. Watching such a film is a great relaxation of the brain. We don&#39;t even need to distinguish who is who, what is the relationship between them, just recognize people according to their appearance. There are black kids who are shaking their heads and energetically, and will bite like dogs. There are middle-aged women who have indulged and sixth-grade memories. They are obsessed with the first love object, and they are entangled. There are fitness trainers who pretend to be cheaper. There are muscle-developed fitness girls who fall in love with ribs men; there are police officers who shoot at the street to open the way; and a group of college brotherhoods whose behavior is the same as that of the tribes.

A mouthful of mud is still smiling. In the table of the cassock, Shaquille O&#39;Neal&#39;s name is very prominent, but his performance in the film is even more eye-catching. This is also due to his huge size, ending with the rescue that turned out to be born. There is simply the shock of the Hulk. Retired sports stars are keen to participate in comedy. In &quot;Hangover&quot;, Tyson proved his funny talents. Later, he started a stand-up comic dialogue. O&#39;Neill&#39;s performance experience is more abundant than him.

In fact, the most exciting tricks are almost in the trailer. But this does not affect the excitement of the film. It is quite fascinating to see how the stuff of these bunkers are combined. A good trailer is to hang up your appetite and not let you watch the film and feel cheated. Compared with the &quot;small-skilled&quot; spy films such as James Bond, Bohnje, and Han Yisheng, the film is more qualified to serve as a job advertisement for the special industry. Everyone knows that Super Agent is happy when he is young, but if he is old, he can continue the legend. No one has said anything. The advertisement of &quot;Red Flame 2&quot; is (the elite will never retire) The best neVer rest, a special job, life is full of scenery, the male to an enemy, do not say, can also soak a number of young women, and let them fight jealous, women not only the age of the armor is still stunned, freehand A group of big men are not in the air. With this group of old elites, the villains must rely on the older old bones to live in the market. Hopkins&#39;s character set is a conspiracy planner and executor. If you fight for justice, it is like Chuck Norris of &quot;The Expendables 2&quot;. It is the existence of the gods under the gods, although the wrong camp is chosen. It can only be smooth, but it is enough to show its charm. Other people murder are panting, he just throws a capsule, licks two knives, completes a great piece of art, elegant and effortless. Even the death of the dead, like an old urchin who lost a game. Looking at a lot of spy films, I hope that the conspiracy of the villains can be won. This time I sincerely hope that Dr. Hannibal can win.",movie
744,"&quot;Aircraft Mobilization&quot; was originally the fate of the straight-forward videotape. The reason why it was able to win the big screen was because Pixar&#39;s big John Russett had slandered. The prototype of the World War II aircraft instructor in the film is his father. &quot;In the name of the father&quot; is always a reason why people cannot be rejected. From another point of view, the origin of the DVD market is nothing to lose. The famous &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; almost missed the big screen that year, and it is still one of my favorite Pixar works. &quot;Aircraft&quot; battled the theater line, the box office return is also gratifying, proving that Lassett&#39;s business decision is correct, but also contributed to the birth of the sequel. At the same time, watching &quot;Aircraft&quot; also made me more disappointed with domestic animation, our highest level, from the people who are on the edge of the disc market, there are hundreds of thousands of miles away, the task is arduous. Having said that, &quot;Aircraft&quot; certainly does not reach the classic quality of &quot;Toy 2&quot;. This time, the critics and fans are surprisingly consistent, meaning that the film lacks originality. The little person carries a dream of a blockbuster, there are too many such legends in the field of animation; the heroâ€™s mentorâ€™s recollection of the past is always reminiscent of the role of Paul Newmanâ€™s voice in â€œThe Story of the Carsâ€, but the truth is that the truth is that the champion wins from all the people who admire the people. Idol, to the face of Yan Zhang, I can understand why the film canceled the domestic release, and the &quot;quick snail&quot; is similar to the schedule. However, in comparison, I prefer the handling of &quot;Aircraft&quot;. The speed of racing is two-thirds, and the villains have made enough sinister tricks. The poor worm in &quot;Snail&quot; is far from so lucky. Just to simply end the loss of the championship, the punishment is too small, I hope that this can be unveiled in the sequel, suffering from the flesh and blood. Multi-national accent players are the best choice for internationalization. The enthusiasm for giving away parts is not logically plausible, but it can be as warm as the ending of Oscar&#39;s business card &quot;Life is Better&quot;. All the old bridges are spliced â€‹â€‹in a delicate way, with the consistent craftsmanship of Disney&#39;s work. Although the ingredients are not fresh enough, the tableware is not refined enough, and the cooking is still sound.",movie

Later, the part of Masterâ€™s beginning and Masterâ€™s study of Kung Fu is quite funny, especially when the performance of the spurs in the classroom makes people feel uncontrollable and then stupid.

746,"Itâ€™s been said that Han Hanâ€™s novel was read very long and long ago. The only impression left is that the novel was quickly and quickly read, and the rest did not remember anything. I vaguely remember that the novel is written about a story related to youth, but I canâ€™t remember what I wrote specifically, and when I think of this topic, I always think of another novel by Han Han, &quot;I want to talk to the world in 1988.&quot; . As far as movies are concerned, I really donâ€™t understand why the works of well-known popular popular writers have been adapted. The â€œOne Cityâ€ has formed a world of difference with â€œLittle Timesâ€. I remember that the release of â€œLittle Timesâ€ even appeared in the theater and only broadcast a movie. The spectacle, and &quot;a city&quot; even disappeared without a trace in the platoon. The film has an obvious comic style. The director used comic images when dealing with many shots. This is also a common trick used by foreign independent films. It is hard to say that this is the key to determining the success or failure of a movie, at least in this film. Even if it is not for cost reasons, the director is also a clever singer. Perhaps you can say that youth is meaningless, you can squander your unscrupulous squandering, and you can use the language of the movie to express this emptiness. It is a question that the director should consider. The absurdity that appears in the lines between the words in the text cannot be an excuse for the pale film. Just like the confusion given to youth in the text of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is not a waste. Obviously, the film failed to grasp it. The essence. Although it is difficult to find out what is worth talking about in this movie, the biggest meaning of the void is meaningless, but in fact, the film director is very good at handling the narrative rhythm. Watching this movie is like reading Han Han&#39;s novels. In one go, the whole movie is very smooth, and a lot of voiceovers are estimated to be borrowed from Han Han&#39;s original text. After all, this ready-made line is not used. In fact, Fang Zumingâ€™s name to play this film is somewhat inexplicable. Itâ€™s awkward to play the obvious Hong Kong and Taiwanese scenes to play the mainland opera. Let the chopsticks brother Wang Taili take the lead in stealing the limelight. Donâ€™t forget the soundtrack of Zuo Xiaozuâ€™s own sword. The unspoken song left a deep impression. Maybe it won&#39;t take long, I just want to forget what I wrote in the novel, and I forgot what the film was filming.",movie
747,"After reading &quot;Dangerous Nest&quot; at Wuchang Yuemao, a lot of audiences exchanged this film with Director Ji Dan. I didn&#39;t grab the microphone. In fact, I still want to say something different from what I want to say below. The biggest problem of this documentary. That is, it is too much like a feature film. The real recording lens is clipped too much. In the last scene, I don&#39;t know what the director wants to record. Of course, I will say that this scene is my favorite one. Another problem is that the cut is too messy, and many story clues are not connected. Next, let&#39;s talk about the topic. The third is in the communication with the director, she clearly said that the dangerous nest was finally removed, and also took this shot, but did not cut into the film, but unfortunately I really feel that it should be cut into it. The gradual deterioration of the living environment is positively related to the family&#39;s living conditions. The house&#39;s demolished indicates that the family&#39;s living conditions have not changed at all. I donâ€™t want to talk about this documentary that reflects the old-fashioned problem of migrant workers working in Beijing and the real life of their children. A very strange feature of this film is that it seems that women have held up most of the day in family life, but their status in family life is completely suppressed by men. We saw in this movie that the two sisters in the working family have been saying, ah, that almost their words occupy the vast majority of the words in the film. They want to tell the teacher about their brotherâ€™s transfer. In order to ask the younger brother to go to school to discuss the problem of two people going to drop out of school, they also need to help their younger brothers to study their homework. The two sisters have almost covered the chores of the whole family. They use their own words to support the daily life of this family, but they have more words. They did not bring them the status of their family. Instead, they were in a state of aphasia in their family status. In the latter half of the film, the migrant workerâ€™s family was completely in a state of male parentship. The two daughters had no status for both the fatherâ€™s parents and the fatherâ€™s son. The arrogance of the two sons, the two daughters are obedient, no one dares to resist the father&#39;s authority to legislate for themselves. Before the discussion of the younger brother&#39;s schooling, the father&#39;s authority has always existed. He almost became the resistance of his son to high school. In response to the younger brother, the two girls first gave up their studies, as if they were completely unimportant, and then it was hard to get the younger brother to go to Huanggang to go to school, but the younger brother had to fight for the right to speak with the two sisters. In the end, donâ€™t stay in Huanggang, sister. Unique displayThe authoritative place is that the film finally accuses the younger brother. In addition, the last scene, we can understand that this family can still not find a way out, in fact, can also be thought of in a heavy snow, the two sisters always have to fall into the black hole of male authority. However, there is a problem, I did not find the difference, the difference in the status of women in working families and ordinary families.",movie

751,"The film, Stalingrad, tells two stories, one is the standard war story, the tug-of-war between several Soviet soldiers in the house on the Volga River and the German army, and the other is the love story. The love story between the girl in the house, Kajia, and several Soviet soldiers, German officers and Russian prostitutes. This multi-line, parallel structure, the most test of the ability of writers and directors, accurately test their creative positioning and structural capabilities. If you put it in the hands of a Hollywood director, you must choose the war story as the main line, so that you can put on the war scenes and sit on the visual impact. In the hands of European directors, most of them will choose to save money but can also produce human brilliance and thick theme of love. The story is the main line. The Russian director of this film chose both, intertwined with each other. Obviously, this is a very risky attempt. From a single story, whether it is a tug-of-war, or a love under the flames of war, you can make a good movie with a sigh of relief. As far as the former is concerned, choose a sniper as the protagonist, that is, &quot;Under the City&quot;, choose a common soldier who can go home but voluntarily stay as the protagonist, that is, &quot;Brigade Ryan&quot;, let the five Soviet soldiers unclearly After many years of donation, I appealed to the government. It is the &quot;assembly&quot;. It is really impossible to write them. They are surrounded by enemies in the house, dying and dying to recall the youthful life. It is also the classic rhythm of &quot;The dawn is quiet here.&quot; If the latter is taken out, the love between several Soviet soldiers and girls must be the main line. The &quot;unruly love&quot; between German officers and Russian prostitutes is the secondary line. The theme of the whole film must be the cruelty and love of war. Eternal contradictions and conflicts between good things. The imaginary war love blockbuster is equally heart-wrenching and tearful: on this side, everyone sacrifices their lives to protect the girl. Although everyone has different personalities and lengths, they all love beautiful girls. When they choose between life and death, they are generous to death, and they are eager to leave the girl and another hope of being alive to their peers, even to their usual contradictory comrades. On the other hand, they enter the Russian and Russian girls in the form of aggressors. The Nazi officer gradually changed from the devil to the &quot;man in love&quot; and then became a good man. Love changed him and changed his fate, but in the end he faced difficult choices. ?? It should be said that such a film will not be ugly, unless it is lacking. The directorâ€™s imagination of the film is obviously not worse than me.I thought about these things, and I tried to put them into the film. For example, in the film, the love between Nazi officers and Russian prostitutes from compulsive to voluntary to sympathetic love has relatively complete clues, and there are also romantic moments. In the fleeing crowd, the manâ€™s shouting shouted, the woman proudly turned back in the old and weak rags, letting him ride his stalking car with his own speed on the ruins of the city, through the disgusting eyes of his compatriots. At this time, the two are no longer part of the hostile two countries, that is, two ordinary men and women who are immersed in love and happy. In the end, this womanâ€™s death is also a rare dark moment in the film. It is not only a pity, but also a sorrowful taste brought by her own intentional or unintentional killing. This taste is related to the burning of jade under the war and the name of justice. The theme of the ambiguous moral judgment in killing. In fact, in front of the film, the sniper taught the girl to shoot, and the German soldiers who intentionally or unintentionally killed the water had already paved the way. Obviously, the Russian director who took more war films never forgot to discuss the moral and human theme in the war, and the Nazi officers against the nobility. The nostalgia of war is also implicit in the creator&#39;s reflection on the war (see Renoir&#39;s classic &quot;The Great Mirage&quot;). Unfortunately, these themes are just flashing and not fully developed, let alone Advance with intense character conflicts and events. In addition, the two sides are facing the same embarrassment in the battle for tug-of-war on the house. In general, the big structure is basically in place, but the lack of smooth transition and rich details, the failure to combine space competition with the urgency of time seems to be thought of, just hit it, and unexpectedly, rest casually. In general, the film has a lot of flashes, but because the structure is loose, the narrative is completely exhausted, the character is not fully developed, and the conflict is always lacking. The story lacks waves, and the whole falls into the dilemma of business and literature. Perhaps the film&#39;s screenwriter and director, like the Nazi officer in the film, did not think about whether they want love, want a woman, or war, and honor. It can be seen that the life gate of mainstream film creation is one, positioning, and the second is pure. (Finish)",movie

753,"At the beginning of 2013, accompanied by Xu Weiâ€™s &quot;Thai?&quot; broke 10, the whole year can be described as the big harvest year of domestic blockbusters. In the first half of the year, the top 5 films of domestic movie box office, except for the other 4 pieces of &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; are Domestically, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, &quot;To Youth&quot;, &quot;Chinese Partner&quot;, &quot;Beijing Meets Seattle&quot; have more than 500 million box office. What is the reason for the domestic film against Hollywood blockbusters, I think one of the most important reasons is that Chinese films have their own good stories. These stories are grounded, have positive values, and are recognized by audiences and critics of all walks of life. Good movie. For a movie, what to write is the first question to think about. In his &quot;The Foundation of Film Script Writing&quot;, Field has a sentence that is intriguing: great movies are eternal? They embody and capture the information of the era in which they were made, and the state of humanity is now and then it&#39;s the same. When you want to create a movie: that is, to ensure his box office, but also to have universal value, Field&#39;s sentence becomes the only code. What kind of China is China in this era? What kind of attitude do people live in in the context of the times? What is friendship? what is love? What is dream? What is the value of human existence? In this &quot;Chinese Partner&quot;, which describes the history of entrepreneurship and dreams of Holly, Meng Xiaojun and Wang Yang, you can find answers to all the above questions. Its success lies in capturing the pulse of the times: people&#39;s dreams about money, immigrant dreams, entrepreneurial dreams, friendship dreams, love dreams, and successful dreams. In the context of a big era (China after the reform and opening up), this film has personal inspiration, buddies, and love. After 60 and 70, there is resonance after reading. After 80 and 90, I have thought about it. From the perspective of dreams and courage and the great universal values â€‹â€‹of human existence, it is enough to satisfy the audience and the critics. So what do viewers need when we create a movie, especially a cinema movie? This is a keen intuition that must be possessed as a storyteller. Art comes from life. When you can&#39;t find inspiration, you can go to the treasure of life, the largest resource to search. Seizing the pulse of the times is the beginning of success. The film is the art of people in action. The character drives the action, the action becomes the event, and the event constructs the plot. The success of a three-dimensional full character, basically the film succeeded.half. &quot;China Partner&quot; is a film based on the founder of New Oriental III. To make this type of film, it is necessary to process it on the basis of reality. It is boring to copy life, and it is necessary to carry out artistic re-creation on the basis of life. Therefore, the three characters played by Huang Xiaoming, Deng Chao, and Dai Dawei presented to the audience are like the three vertices of the triangle. From the perspective of origin, Cheng Dongqing is a peasant; Da Dawei, a typical middle class; Deng Chao has such a sense of consciousness of the elite class (after all, in that era, grandfather and father have been abroad and are not ordinary families). In real life, the lower, middle and upper levels have their own character comparisons. In terms of personality, the film began to become a young man, inferiority; Wang Yang romantic, chic; Meng Xiaojun with innate superiority and purposeful confidence. At the same time they are developing towards a hidden character. In the development of the incident, Cheng Dongqing became smooth and confident, Wang Yang became simple and moderate; Meng Xiaojun was not confident and became restrained and silent. A good movie character is also a process of returning to the original. At the end of the movie, when Meng Xiaojun used to work in a restaurant, Cheng Dongqingâ€™s reality, Meng Xiaojunâ€™s self-confidence, Wang Yangâ€™s chic was back. Therefore, the structure of the triangle, in the process of three metamorphosis, the character is very full and three-dimensional. The third is an odd number. In composition and narratology, the relationship between the three is unstable. In the movie, Cheng Dongqing and Meng Xiaojun are full of conflicts. These conflicts exist in their origins: the bottom and upper layers, the winners and the losers, and their contradictions are also in the reversal of their character and experience. In the study of Yanjing University, Meng Xiaojun became the idol of Cheng Dongqing. In the Oxford Dictionary given to Cheng Dongqing, Meng Xiaojun wrote: One day you will make me jealous. In the new dream of entrepreneurship, Meng Xiaojun still looks down on Cheng Dongqing. Whether the new dream is listed directly leads to the conflict between the two people. When Cheng Dongqing absorbed the new shareholders to dilute the three shares, the conflict broke out for the first time, followed by In the incident of &quot;Southern Union sentiment to fight new dreams&quot;, the action of Cheng Dongqing made the &quot;å«‰å¦’&quot; in the subconscious really come to the surface of Meng Xiaojun. Therefore, he chose to stay, and this reservation is actually recognized. Dong Qingâ€™s â€œhead wolfâ€ status. Wang Yang&#39;s wedding night, the break of the brothers, is very reasonable, although Wang Yang has the least amount of ink in the film, but this character setting is the most outstanding, from the most debauchery at the beginning to the middle of the future,Then the choice of marriage and the tiredness of drinking are really exhausted. I chose to quit, which made him have a little &quot;tragic hero&quot; atmosphere. He acts as a mediator of two people who are facing conflicts. In this mediation, the choice is The price is to sacrifice the self. After all, the three people in their inner character are good enough, high enough, enough to be the first wolf, but only one. The success of a character is not only a person who needs three-dimensional characters, but also a relationship of people who have enough conflicts, and the relationship between the characters needs to be reversed from time to time. The &quot;Chinese Partner&quot; has done it. At the time of the climax, the reconciliation of the three people is not only The redemption of the character&#39;s nature is the recovery of the relationship of the characters. Third, the dramatic needs of the characters: life, idealism, pragmatism drives the action, under the theme of personal inspiration, the need to find the dramatic needs of the characters. If the &quot;Chinese Partner&quot; is summed up in one sentence, the most appropriate one may be: the process of achieving the dream of three people. What is that dream? This question is simple but complicated. The dreams at each stage are different, and the time to think at each stage is different. When we were young, we answered this question very quickly: I want to be a scientist, I want to be a boss... Youth is the most purposeful moment. In &quot;China Partner&quot;, their dream is the United States. Then, after we step into the society? The author&#39;s dream was to become a good director. When you face society, when you see the essence of something, your dreams will be shaken. First, is he suitable for you? Second, can you persist? The cost of pure things can be a lifetime. When Cheng Dongqing was repeatedly rejected, Wang Yang stayed because of love, Meng Xiaojun&#39;s unfair treatment in the United States, let their American dreams die, everyone after a brief confusion, had a new dream of this training trust. In the second half, the movie did not give a clear indication of the dream. Only Meng Xiaojun repeatedly questioned Cheng Dongqing. Do you still have a dream? Cheng Dongqing avoids answering every time. This is a god of the movie. If the dream becomes a very real thing, for example, the director tells the dream of the partner through the lines of the character, then the movie is generalized. But as the creator of the story, the director and the screenwriter must understand the dramatic needs of the character. On the surface, this demand is the trust empire of the new dream. Behind the surface, the most essential problem is the realization of personal values. What is dream? Dreams are the realization of personal values. EachPeople have different values, so their dreams are different. Young people pursue the American dream because of the American dream. In their vision, they think that the United States will realize their value under the premise of being equal to opportunities. One of the repeated remarks in the film is whether we changed the world or whether the world has changed us. Look at Wang Yang&#39;s choice: because Lucy, give up the American dream; be willing to act as a mediator of three people; marrying a woman who is not beautiful and not thinking about herself, no doubt his dramatic needs are the most realistic: life. Meng Xiaojun: Realizing the American dream, I found that the United States did not choose to leave, and chose to stay in the &quot;Southern Union sentimental warfare&quot; (in fact, it acquiesced to the status of Chengdong Qingtou wolf), in the new dream did not follow their own He chose to leave in his listing intention. His dramatic demand is: the embodiment of the self. This embodiment is not pure material, but more idealistic, so he is confused. Cheng Dongqing, when there was no Wang Yang in his youth, no Meng Xiaojun had capital, he insisted on visas to the United States. When he failed to achieve it, he chose to be a tutor in the context of teaching. After choosing the tutor, he chose to review and was dismissed. In the new dream road, in the new dream of entrepreneurship, countless times to accept Meng Xiaojun&#39;s YES, the key moment knows NO, his dramatic needs are simple: success and consolidate his success, he is a true contemporary China success Human portrayal: a pragmatist who can understand and maximize the benefits. Three attitudes to life are the portrayal of all Chinese today: lifeism (trivialism), idealism, and pragmatism. Therefore, we are looking at the common &quot;new dream trust empire dream&quot;, three people in their position, and make their own decisions. After all, for the realization of a group&#39;s dream, someone must sacrifice. Under specific events, the three people have different choices of lifeism, idealism, and pragmatism. There are contradictions, conflicts, and plots. The essence of film narrative is the problem of form and content, that is, the problem of plot and structure. First, the plot should be attractive enough, and the second structure should serve the expression of the plot. Analyze and create a film, one of which depends on its plot. The plot is the soul of a movie. Aristotle defines it in Poetics as a combination of events. The definition in &quot;Chinese Dictionary&quot; is: the change and passing of things. The story of &quot;China Partner&quot; is relatively simple: the partner of the same American dream, in the American dreamAfter the burst, realize the story of the new dream trust empire. In this relatively simple story of the overall plot, it is more necessary to carefully design the plot. From the literal dismantling point of view: whether it has a typical event that better reflects the whole; whether it can reflect the beginning, process and ending of the matter in a single event, that is, the details; whether the process of change makes the film have the omission of its narrative characteristics Extend, that is, the rhythm problem. &quot;China Partner&quot; is largely successful in setting the plot. I have done a selection of typical, detailed, and rhythmic events. For example, in the love between Cheng Dongqing and Sumei: two people met, and in the middle of the night, the two fled to the library to study, Samuiâ€™s candle was extinguished, and he squeezed into the candle of Cheng Dongqing to read the book; Cheng Dongqing expressed love. Italian, JosÃ© Maye went to the river, and Su Mei jumped into the river himself; the two officially confirmed that Su Mei, who had a relationship with Dong Qingqiang, had pneumonia and was infected. With a good plot, then what is the structure of the plot. The structure first has a method of emotional nodes at the logical level of the story. It is obviously inappropriate to analyze the film with the traditional three-scene two-node method. The traditional emotional node can be regarded as three. After Wang Yang Airport bid farewell to Lucy, burn off the written poems and cut off the hair; Su Mei and Cheng Dongqing propose to break up, this continuation paragraph of the love node is particularly good, Shenao The sentiment of failure continued into the mood of Cheng Dongqing. Chengdongâ€™s blue and white walked on the street. The foreground was a TV that was smashed down. The background was to give China a chance and a miracle in the world. After Meng Xiaojun returned to China, she cut her hair. These three emotional nodes, the complete breakdown of the American dream of three people, heralds a new beginning for their lives. The emotional node 2 can be divided into two. After the wedding breaks, the three people parted ways, and this emotional node is aimed at a collective breakdown. When watching this movie, the first half is obviously better than the latter half. The reason is that the structure in front is the explanation for the three people, and there are many turning points for the plot; the latter half is a collective, only one collective turn. . After the logical plot structure is completed, what is more important is how to present it to the audience. This is also the most successful place for the partner narrative. In the structure of time, the EES is now negotiating time and space for the prosecution of new dreams. This time and space scene is simple and the duration is short. The narrative space is in the third act, and there are fewer in the first and second acts. It is the role of interspersed with the plot. The time and space of the key narrative is the realization of the trio of American dreams to the realization of the new dream trust empire, with the appearance of flashbackNow, occupy the main body, and combine the time and space with the present in the third act. This structure is very similar to a &quot;social network&quot; in the United States in 2010. The difference between the two in the narrative is that the &quot;Chinese partner&quot; used the narration to plot the plot in the plot, and used the expression of the narrative to account for a very The large proportion has a flashback in the flashback. For personal motivation, this kind of time and space and structure and narration into the story, make the film closer to the audience, the audience can be more empathetic to the story. Imagine if the &quot;Chinese Partner&quot; is told by a linear narrative structure and a reproducible approach, it will certainly flow in the general. Therefore, when creating a story, a good plot is the key, and how to arrange a good plot can not be ignored. The film is the product of the times. Through the action of the character (the plot), the film writer delivers some kind of thought, and the audience experiences this idea. This is the theme of the film. Type movies don&#39;t require particularly complex themes (including the complexity of human nature). The most successful part of Hollywood movies is the hegemonic output of American culture at the time of his big box office. Chinese film (especially the film influenced by the Soviet Union after 49 years, which is different from the film under the Kuomintang and the current Hong Kong film, Taiwanese film) is often preaching in past experience. This kind of preaching is reflected in the characters. Directly instilling reason, not reflecting the thoughts and principles of a person through the actions of the characters. &quot;China Partner&quot; is an inspirational type of film about people&#39;s realization of their dreams. The output of the inspirational film theme is that the audience is watching the history of the characters&#39; struggles and comprehending their own lives. Although there are many reasons why the &quot;Chinese Partner&quot; has a direct protagonist, it is very reasonable. This rationality is due to the particularity of the storyline: the educator delivers certain ideas to the educated; the second is that the educational thoughts it conveys have some contrast. In short, by understanding the &quot;struggling history of the characters&quot; &quot;And looking for history&quot;, the role of the philosophical discourse of the character is double or even more. Cheng Dongqingâ€™s courage, Meng Xiaojunâ€™s dreams, and the consistent successes and losers, we can all respond to the characters. &quot;China Partner&quot; and this year&#39;s Chinese dream can echo in some places, so he gets more attention. Many film critics are questioning whether the values â€‹â€‹they bring out are correct. First, for their own success, they don&#39;t need to Care about the harm that others bring; second, take all improper means to steal and possess all the resources that are convenient for you, such as KFC KingIn the Yangkou, the uncles of the American uncle and Cheng Dongqing chose to abandon the state-owned enterprises as school buildings and drilled the gaps of state-owned enterprises. Third, they exaggerated the confrontation between success and failure, and ridiculed the losers. The teaching principle of New Oriental is not to become a loser. . Fourth, education has become an industry, and there is a tendency to worship money. Fifth, the attitude toward the United States is unclear, love and hate, and it is suspected of confusing students. The author believes that consciousness as a reflection of material, some current mainstream thinking can not be deliberately avoided as good or bad; right or wrong. After all, &quot;China Partner&quot; is a commercial line of cinema. He reflects the thoughts and values â€‹â€‹of a certain era. What he has endowed and shared is a social reality: the success history of a generation, the history of youth. The history of dreams, deliberately exaggerating the issue of arguing about its ideology, has given too much burden to the film itself. What is most needed for the development of Chinese film is to alleviate the political burden of the body. I believe that the storyteller concentrates on his own craftsmanship and puts down his political ambitions. As a transmitter of the times and positive energy, Chinese movies will rush out of Asia and go to the world. The conclusion returns to Field&#39;s definition of a good movie: great movies are eternal? They embody and capture the information of the era in which they were made, and the state of humanity is the same now and at that time.",movie
754,"1. At the beginning of the Red Army&#39;s night attack landing, everyone did not know what was in front of them. They could only see a piece of Red Cross on the other side, and came from time to time. 2, the squad sneak attack failed, was crushed by the German army, the German military officer pressed a button to blow up the oil depot, the fire destroyed the entire landing Red Army. The Red Army soldier rolled down the slope. 3. Then, above the defensive Germans looked at the back of the raging fire, countless Soviet Qiu Shaoyun roared from the fire and twisted his face to the German position. Personally think that the absolute Oscar level, the German defense under this psychological pressure directly collapsed. 4, Kajia obviously does not have Martha beautiful, but there are several men around Kajia, Martha has only one German officer Kahn who raped her but never abandoned her. 5. Is the sniper eating dry rice, and Kahn has not missed him so many times. Is it that the Red Army fighters also understand the rules of the Prussian aristocracy? 6. In the last paragraph, I thought that Kahn had met Martha and Kajia with Martha, and then there was various friction in the firefighter building without any civilians. But in the end, Nima did not have a conflict. Martha was also killed by a sniper, and then Kahn blew his tank and threw six daddy-hidden buildings. Finally, I went upstairs to fight with Dagu, but unfortunately the gunfire that was called by the coward was buried. In short, I have so much experience. I always feel that the first half of the story is full of blood. Qiu Shaoyun rushed to the enemy from the fire, and then the three-dimensional battle of the sea, land and air, the stage of death on the Volga River. But the second half is obviously a love scene. Kajia lay on the musician&#39;s lap and told her a story. Then in the war, the six dads found a bath in Kajia, braving the hot water to let her bathe. The musician sang a song for her, and the coward once again liked her and didn&#39;t look at her body. She only took her away and went to a place where she would not be attacked. Returning to the building and returning to the Germans. ?? Martha because of the wife of the German officer Kahn, Kahn also sent food from the war to her, but also raped her, but Martha has been very silent, rarely speak, whether before or in Later, even when the Germans brought together the Russians in the city, Kahn would drive the Martha in the open. Even his superiors are there. He also wants to take her away. Finally Martha was killed by the sniper and Kahn was desperate. Maternal love, at the beginning, in order to force out the Red Army hidden in the building, the Germans pushed a Jewish woman and her child into an abandoned car to burn him.When the flames enveloped around, the mother said to the child, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid, someone will save us.&quot; Love, the coward said to Kajia, I love you, I fell in love with seeing your second eye. you. Kajia replied, I love you too. In this way, two people saw the sunrise of the ruined Stalingrad in the uninhabited fire building. Love, Martha is lying on Kahn&#39;s lap, Kahn asks what love is, answering himself, love is that I love you.",movie
755,"The heroine has a bright career and has a stable and excellent boyfriend but has not yet decided on a marriage contract. According to the inability of the heroine, she planned to marry her boyfriend to go out to propose a marriage to her boyfriend, but she smashed her true love on the road. The above is a synopsis of the movie &quot;The Year of the Leap&quot;, and it is also the general story of &quot;Unexpected Love Time&quot;. The story is the same as the vulgarity. In any case, the romantic comedy is like most fairy tales. The woman always finds true love, and the lover will eventually become a genus. Few of the princesses in the fairy tale were killed by the apple. The prince took the princess&#39;s long hair on the tower and took the princess&#39;s scalp off. But when I knew that &quot;Unexpected Love Time&quot; already had a known ending, there was no bright spot in the middle, except that I really didn&#39;t know what to do when I was watching the film. When I saw the movie poster, I donâ€™t want to have Dove chocolate. I didnâ€™t expect it to appear. When I saw the name of Fang Zu, I thought, donâ€™t play a pure silk? I didnâ€™t really want to play a startup youth technology house. I thought about it when I was riding a bicycle. Donâ€™t fall, I didnâ€™t expect it to fall. I thought about it when I started eating sweet potatoes. Donâ€™t use the rotten stalk of fart. I didnâ€™t expect it to be used. I thought about it from the broken bench of Fang Zuming Station. Donâ€™t fall down with Guo Caijie. I didnâ€™t want to really rush. I think from the appearance of the marriage proposal ring, don&#39;t tell me that the size is not suitable, I didn&#39;t expect it to be really inappropriate. The screenwriter should be based on the story of the &quot;500 most popular film and television drama series&quot;. I am most impressed by the drama that should not be forgotten in my life. When Guo Caijie and Fang Zuming were penniless, they just met the &quot;Yangmei Fairy Contest&quot; which was held by about three people and won 500 prizes. There is a basket of bayberry. Really not playing around, no matter what towns and towns do not listen to &quot;Good Han&quot; now, don&#39;t sing two Wang Feng Liu Zhe, but also play Xu Liang Zhang Jie Wang Suzhen&#39;s complete works, don&#39;t discredit our party Urbanization process. On the finale, Guo Caijie took the stage to &quot;test whether humans can hear the sound below 20 Hz&quot; and sang a cold field to the extreme &quot;follow the feeling&quot;. The audience also took a chance to compare what humans can fake high to what degree. During the period, the name of the ancestors did not know where to find a wig to perform on the stage to perform a fire-breathing ......... This plot is not the most whimsical than the fairy tale. The two wake up from the cabin and the makeup is neat and radiant. Is there a little elf to help wash the makeup in the middle of the night? Falling into the water, soakingItâ€™s really practical to walk through the mountains and walk through the jungle. Guo Caijie struggled to marry her boyfriend, and the final result was &quot;You have already left, then I am going home too&quot;, can make the plot no longer exist? Fang Zuming&#39;s mobile phone is probably Changhong Xiao Zhiling&#39;s long standby time for 30 days without charging and external portable solar charging board. Rotten stalks are not a comedy ingredient, and the actual childishness is not a fresh love. I remember that there is a &quot;boys have those who can be sentenced to zero points.&quot; In the selection of &quot;too much dependence on mothers&quot; seems to be fatal, so I am really not sure that the role of Fang Zuming is set to please. Moreover, every sect of Fangâ€™s name was able to pinch out the cold sweat, especially on the bus and his motherâ€™s phone call. Every line simply tells you â€œIâ€™m acting, and itâ€™s bad.â€ I think he is better off holding his father&#39;s thighs than playing some tepid films. Guo Caijie took Yan Zhan&#39;s stick and planned to sit on the position of Warner Fresh Department&#39;s sister. So far, she has made three or four albums. Even if one is better than one, it is always far from the day after the word, even like the golden song. Any awards have not yet been finalized, so acting is a good way to change the runway. And this road has also gone smoothly, &quot;One Page Taipei&quot; Taipei Film Festival won the award, &quot;Love&quot; is also shortlisted for the best female partner of Golden Horse, &quot;Little Times&quot; topic is red. Therefore, I only hope that she can carefully select films in the future. This mediocre and uninteresting film will not be picked up, which will waste time resources and consume good feelings. From the &quot;second age&quot;, Guo Caijie&#39;s &quot;two-generation love with no material love is a plate of sand&quot; turned into a small happiness that pursued &quot;sleeping to wake up naturally, when the man woke up, the man had brought the breakfast to you&quot; Confident innocent girl. So, is this close to the audience&#39;s life? Even if you don&#39;t open the 600 million-dollar project, most of the audience can&#39;t come to a marriage proposal that walks away, without thinking about buying two ugliness that can be directly thrown down the mountain. Agate boxed ring. And, really, I really want to burn the actor who plays the Korean drama hotel owner, and I have no reason to be disgusting. Please contact the team or individual who is good at assassination. Although &quot;Unexpected Love Time&quot; is really not a bad film, at least the big back light big close-up Guo Xiao bird&#39;s exquisite face is beautiful. But not bad is not enough, because boring is more terrible than rotten, rotten tablets can at least spit a slot when watching, boring can only die and do not doze off. This film is actually scheduled to be released during the Singles Day. If several singles meet to go to the movies,In the end, all of them fell asleep at the cinema, which should only make sadness more sad. The most irritating thing is that if you buy a movie ticket, you don&#39;t want to send chocolate, so why should I go in and watch the advertisement for two hours?",movie
756,"[Spoiler Alert! The following content is related to the leakage of some story stories, which may affect the viewing.] &quot;Thirteen&quot; is a straightforward movie, and one is a group of shots. Daughter Li played talks about her dreams and her father waited for a new life. However, the lens has turned around and surrounded the examination education with Chinese characteristics. The long and short subjects that most people have encountered while studying, the father and the daughter broke out. &quot;The teacher and the parents are all for you,&quot; but the daughter refused to give in. As a result, the father violently interfered, and the contradiction was settled. So at the end, when the father was in tears in the car and said that he was not a good father, the father and the daughter reached a reconciliation. But at this time, Li played suddenly seems to grow up, accepting the edges and corners being smoothed, quiet, sensible, listening to the words of adults. She no longer hopes to even find Einstein, and no longer mentions a brief history of parallel cosmic time. She finally falls back to the real world in front of her, and the camera looks at the weaker brother. Many people will guess in advance that this may be a positive energy film that tells the story of human dog love and love, and does not want to backfire. &quot;Dog Thirteen&quot; is turned down and punctures the possibility of any good hope. People are uncomfortable and have been suffocating for a long time. The dog in the movie title, two Einstein, they became the flammable and explosive items of the father-daughter war. This kind of youth growth theme is just a lot of Chinese mainland. They often tell the audience as soon as they come up. This is a problem student, skipping classes, rebellious, running away from home, and guiding the characters early. Li Shi of &quot;Thirteen Dogs&quot; seems to be more realistic. She is not so special, she has a school uniform and her face is still childish. The conflicts of the film almost all come from within the family, especially in the speech contest, the object that really makes her nervous, tired and sad, is also the father. This is a little girl who lacks maternal love. Her meager family love comes from her grandparents, and she is also divided and deprived by her newer brother (although she didn&#39;t know it for most of the time). Even so, she still has nowhere to escape. After all, that person is also the father who loves her. Even if this love is wrong in many cases. Such in-depth educational ideas have been instilled, and I donâ€™t think there is anything wrong with this line. The desire to choreographed was too strong, and &quot;Thirteen&quot; became too straightforward. For example, when Li is not really inseparable from the puppy (maybe she is really too lonely), the puppy is lost, she burst into tears and burst into an instant. For example, at the end, in order to lead the father to Li to play with the younger brother, thisThe growth cycle of a ring and a ring, the film has more to drink milk rollerblading, as if routinely summed up. If you trim some branches, and the girl will end up crying alone, the power will not be weakened. The current situation is that &quot;Thirteen&quot; has many traces of axe, and the character motives and bridge design are too obvious. In the time span, it is still because of the existence of the younger brother, but there is no small problem. His growth rate is much faster than the speed of Liâ€™s study. The best piece of the film should be sudden domestic violence. This paragraph is so real that I was thinking, some friends said it was the most shocking movie of the year, probably from here. In addition to the father&#39;s authority in the Ming Dynasty, behind the bathroom to play dogs, Li played to comfort the barking dog, father holding a net bag, has been standing behind her. The father who was in the depth of the field, though imaginary, was firmly fixed on the prey. The object he wanted to capture was no longer a dog, but a daughter. This is an anxious father. He is not an absolute negative image of alcoholism, but it seems to break out at any time. In the self-talk, the father who is &quot;always busy&quot; will also have a heartfelt joy to sing &quot;The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is Good&quot; and &quot;The Golden Mountain of Beijing&quot;. The rock music that the daughter listens to is completely Two worlds. Of course, the soundtrack that seems too full in the film is another matter. &quot;Dog Thirteen&quot; also has bats that have been shot down in the classroom. There are &quot;birds&quot; who have been towed up by 120 on the upstairs. Animals cannot be fierce. In the relief station, Li played looking for the second Einstein. The lens is a piece of cage. The dogs are looking at each other, meaning no need to say anything. Ferocious to some &quot;unteaching&quot; Li play, can not escape being hit, domesticated, and finally took the initiative to accept the advice, eat the braised pork, put on the growth of the spell, step into the adult world. Before the adult&#39;s depiction of the lonely environment, her loneliness is like the ivy on the wall, which can only spread quietly. Such a youthful growth story, without landscaping and hope, can only be reluctantly or reluctantly compromised and obeyed. I am afraid that many viewers (especially female audiences) are basically non-resisting. In the previous edition of the film, I saw that the ending subtitles appeared to care for animals and not to eat dog meat. I was thinking, this is where. At the same time as the death of the audience, &quot;Thirteen Thirteen&quot; wants to criticize the strict authority of the father and the way of Chinese education. Perhaps, I can also say directly, the title of the film is a swearword. After all, many times, swearing is more real than lie.

758,"Stars rely on film making, they can&#39;t make big money. Therefore, any brokerage company that runs its own artists is focused on future advertising endorsements. The box office is one of the most direct and effective ways to test the value of the star market. Therefore, a large number of actresses have entered the film market, even at the expense of buying box office. As a newcomer, I also tried to find a shortcut to fame. Taking a third-level film is undoubtedly a good choice. The mainland has not released the third-level film so far, and many actresses have chosen to go south to Hong Kong, &quot;the curve saves the country.&quot; Wang Li Danni, the female star of &quot;To the West,&quot; is one of them. She also won the high popularity on the mainland with this film. However, we may wish to ask, is there a big distance between the three stars and the stars? Even if the light is emptied, the real endorsement fee is only a million. Wang Li Danni, the big breast sister, if you want to develop hard, you must take a Shu Qi general whitewashing road. In this context, the film &quot;The Stick of Light&quot; became the first work of Wang Li Danni to wash his own. We can speculate that Wang Li Danniâ€™s participation is due to the personal will of Zhang Tiansheng, the boss behind the film. This old Zhang is completely motivated to bring a porn star into his own movie. Of course, we should consciously block the illusion of &quot;Liu Zhijun in the Red House crew&quot;, although this reverie is based on reality. Judging from the drama of the film king Li Danni, she still did not get out of the shackles of &quot;All the Way to the West&quot;. She could only take the opportunity to sell her chest and sell the game, but this time she should fully take care of the censorship system of mainland movies. Too obvious, only two big rabbits can hide the little red dot. The audience who are watching the mentality of &quot;All the Way to the West&quot; is probably disappointed with &quot;The Stick of Light&quot;. At the same time, Wang Li Danni, who was starred by a three-level film, turned into a supporting role for the singer. Although she was able to turn around and finally meet the audience in the mainland cinema, it was progressing or degrading. Aside from the glamorous star, we look at the movie itself alone, but there are also many gimmicks. In the movie, if the fans look carefully, they will find the female No. 1 Xu Jieer &quot;silk on the knees.&quot; Knees, actresses, bruises, these words, the reader can naturally fully associate. These may be due to the bruising caused by the backward movement. In the movie, the time is good and bad, the irregularity occurs, the front is still slightly injured, and the back is about to get off the fire line. The knee of the female No. 1 is far better than the movie itself. At this point, it is inevitable that you can&#39;t limit the similar associations between &quot;Liu Zhijun and the Red House actress&quot;. I don&#39;t know, weCan Zhang Tiansheng, the investor of the show, smile and say, I wish Zhang Ye to make a big profit after making a big profit. The film script itself does not pass, lack of sincerity and poor skill. In addition, the shooting of the man-made harbour in Caofeidian, Tangshan, is really a drop. On the bare sea, there is a little bit of scenery. I wonder if the art teacher of the show is fooling with Wang Li Danniâ€™s sister? In addition to the hard implant of a hotel in Caofeidian, people really doubt that the director is holding this hotel, or to use his own poor shooting techniques to darken. Even in the last smog of the film, in the opposite building, the director is telling everyone, is Tangshan a heavily polluted city? This movie, which is attended by Tangshan Literary Federation, is a bit reactionary. &quot;Light Stick&quot; is far-fetched, to reduce the actor&#39;s IQ as the main way of amusement. Although the film begins with the joke of &quot;Crazy Pure Thief&quot;, the playwright does not surpass the thief&#39;s scriptwriter, and is even far away. Behind. Films with the theme of blind date, in recent years, have been on the cinema, at least a dozen, the bridges that can be borrowed are too numerous to enumerate. Although the drama writers plagiarized the nutrition of their predecessors, they were chaotic and chaotic in their own rules. In particular, the lens was used to re-create the idea of â€‹â€‹the male No. 1 blind date scene. Compared with the American movie &quot;The World of Truman&quot;, the &quot;camera&quot; bridge section is high and low, at a glance. In such a movie, Wang Li Danni undoubtedly re-questioned her own future. Of course, &quot;The Stick of Light&quot; will only be turned on in mid-June, and it will be released in November. Under the premise that many film cycles often take a year or more, we have reason to suspect that the film is rushed and edited. It is specially made for the Singles Day. However, the author visually surveyed Zhang Tiansheng&#39;s elder brother, the abdomen, the cigar in the mouth, swallowing clouds, not like a cultural person, and engaged in the appearance of energy. Energy bosses can invest in art, and everyone must affirm themselves. Just as I said in the latest old horse talk show, Yangzhou salt merchants show off their hatefulness? But this is a group of brain-filled guys who have raised the artistic prosperity of Yangzhou Eight Monsters in the Ming Dynasty. Capital and art will always support each other in public opinion. Just as the author wrote this article, I chatted with Zhang Tianshengâ€™s brother about a few private letters. I said, I may have to criticize it. Lao Zhang said â€œnothingâ€, out of the derogatory meaning of the energy boss. In a sentence, the biggest point of the film is really on the back of the female No. 1 knee, not afraid of the entertainment circle (jUan) Lively, don&#39;t miss it.",movie
759,"Once again, I opened Yuan&#39;s book and listened to him about history. In fact, what is really interesting to me is that Teacher Yuan has a voice. It feels that it is more open and humorous. It seems that moving his class to the screen or on the Internet seems to be Let him be subject to certain restrictions, and the words that are said seem to have to be considered, so that there is a lot less taste, and the content of the lectures in the form of books is not so good. Teacher Yuan has published too many books recently. It seems that she can&#39;t see it, and every book is super expensive. This book is about Xixia Dynasty. The 200-page paper in the district actually sells 34, but I am a loyal fan of Yuan. Not so careless, and his words are easy to understand, quoting the classical Chinese and translating into a verbal vernacular, it is also quite suitable for me to see this semi-literate, unlike the books I have read before, telling a person or a piece I will not understand the matter when I moved out of the &quot;Historical Records&quot; or the history of the 24th. Regarding the history of Xixia, there are not many that I usually see, and Yuan teacher can make up for a blank. China began to form a tradition from the Tang Dynasty. When the DPRK gave history to the former dynasty, it said that I inherited your orthodoxy and learned the lessons of the rise and fall of the former ruins. After the reunification of the Yuan Dynasty, the &quot;Liao History&quot;, &quot;Song History&quot; and &quot;Golden History&quot; were compiled. That is to say, the Liao and Jin Dynasties were the orthodox dynasties of China in the eyes of the Yuan Dynasty. However, the Xixia, which was established in conjunction with the Liao and Jin Dynasties, does not see the official records. There is no &quot;Western Xia History&quot; in the twenty-fourth history. The history of Xixia is recorded in &quot;Liao History&quot;, &quot;Song History&quot; and &quot;Golden History&quot;, and belongs to the foreign biography in the biography. After reading this book, I published my personal opinion. In fact, although Xixia founded the country, it has always belonged to the genus of the Liao and Song Dynasties. The party-based nation finally disappeared into the family of the Chinese nation. Its history is of course difficult to be respected. However, although Xixia has not been recognized as an orthodox dynasty, its influence is very large and its existence time is very long. If it is built from the end of the Tang Dynasty, the ancestor Tuo Si Si Gong established the town, and it was destroyed by the Mongolian iron ride. For over a hundred and fifty years, even from the founding of the Yuan Dynasty, the emperor has a hundred and ninety years, and the two Songs have a total of three hundred and twenty years, two hundred and twenty years of Liaoning, and one hundred and twenty years of gold. Why is Tuoba also surnamed Li? This goes back to the early Tang Dynasty. At that time, the party leader Tuo Tuoâ€™s resignation was returned to the Tang Dynasty. The Emperor Taizong was very happy. He gave the countryâ€™s surname Li and was named the county, so the history of Xixia The emperor surnamed Li. A book also basically describes the replacement of the emperor of the Li family and what happened during the reign of each emperor. Sort out the Western Xia dynasty monarchs that are not on the Xinhua Dictionary. Li Jiqian, in 997, was again appointed as a difficultThe military festival makes it possible to govern the five states of summer, silver, sui, sui, and quiet. In 1002 AD, he captured Lingzhou (now the south of Lingwu County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region), renamed Xiping House, set up official positions, and reorganized the army, laying the foundation for the later establishment of Xixia. Li Deming, after inheriting the leader of the party tribe, led the party to return to the Song Dynasty. The signing of the Jingde Peace Treaty has enabled the party-governing nations that have experienced decades of war to recuperate and grow stronger. The most characteristic of its governance is &quot;Liao and Song&quot;, and at the same time, it is called Liao and Song, accepting the title of the two countries, and waiting for the opportunity to develop to the west. In the past few years, the Western attacked Tubo and Huiyu, and seized Xiliangfu, Ganzhou, Guazhou, Shazhou and other places. Its sphere of influence extends to Yumenguan and the entire Hexi Corridor. Since &quot;Liao and Song&quot; can paralyze Liao and Song, the &quot;nation&quot; can be peaceful, and the internal can also focus on economic development, so that the agriculture in the area under its jurisdiction has a greater development. Throughout his life, he not only succeeded in preserving his ancestral foundation, but also constantly expanding his power. Li Yuanzhang, an important figure in the book, was born as a leader. His personality is arrogant, and he is well-versed. He is well versed in the teachings of Buddhism. Tubo, Huiwen and Hanwen all recognize that the law is clear, and this person is both civil and military. Yuan Zhenâ€™s view is that the party-based nation is already strong enough and should never be subject to others. Therefore, he has already broken with the Song Dynasty and called Wang Tubaâ€™s ambition. After his fatherâ€™s death, he finally waited for an opportunity to show his strength. In 1038, Li Yuanzhang officially called the emperor. He was Xia Jingzong, the country was Bai Gaoda Xia Guo, and later known as Xi Xia. At this time, the ruler of the Northern Song Dynasty was Song Renzong. He spent six years preparing for the founding of the country, changing his name, issuing bald orders, changing clothing, building a city, establishing controls, reforming the ritual system, and creating texts. In order to call the emperor to kill the cousin, cousin, mother, wife and cousin and all their sons. Li Yuanzhang said that the emperor founded the country, and returned the seals and scripts given to him by the Song Dynasty, and publicly opposed the Song Dynasty. Yuan Zhen dared to do this, in addition to a solid military backing, strong armed forces, but also because he has a think tank composed almost entirely of Han Chinese, Yuan Zhen listened to these people. At the beginning of the founding of the Yuan Dynasty, there were six masters of the chief counselor. In addition to one party, the remaining five were Han Chinese. This scene was repeated again and again in the wars of the Central Plains and the various frontiers. Whether it was Liao, Jin, Xixia, or later Yuan Dynasty, Qing Dynasty, and at the beginning of the founding of the country, most of the main proposals were in the Central Plains. Han scholars who are unwilling to be ambitions. The most famous of the Han dynasty Hans are two people, oneCalled Zhang Yuan, one is Wu Hao. Yuan Zhen led the troops to cut Song, mainly because of their ideas, especially Zhang Yuan. In 1040, Li Yuanzhang personally led hundreds of thousands of troops, crossed the border between Xixia and Northern Song Dynasty, and directly attacked Yanzhou City, which is today&#39;s Yan&#39;an, Shaanxi. Li Yuanzhangâ€™s troops have a lot of attention. The most elite troops are called Tielin Army, also known as the Iron Scorpion Army. In fact, they are heavy armored cavalry. It is impossible to lock people and horses together. It is impossible for them to escape. These three thousand people, There is no retreat in the fight, there is no death, and you can only go forward. In addition to the Tielin Army, there is also the Yusheng Army, which has 100,000 troops. It is the most armed force in Xixia. As the name suggests, it is the capture of prisoners on the battlefield. There is also a unit called Liu Panzhi, which is equivalent to Li Yuanzhang&#39;s Yulin Army. All of them are filled by noble children, about 5,000 people, and a total of six. The army with the fewest numbers is called the Xixi Army, and there are only two hundred people, the artillery. What is most inventive and meaningful is that he has compiled a unit called the squadron. The number is more than 100,000. All of them are composed of prisoners. They fight to make the squadron go first and reduce the casualties of the party soldiers. Because you are Captive, life is not worth the money. Li Yuanzhang, the head of the Xixia Kingdom, defeated the Song Army three times in Sanchuankou, Haoshuichuan and Dingchuan Village. The reasons for winning are as follows: First, Xia Guo always concentrates on superior forces, each destroys the enemy, and Song Jun is too long. Tossing and exhausting, sometimes the government has many doors, so that the generals are at a loss, and the generals are no shortage of arrogant soldiers, and they are on paper, so they always defeat. Secondly, Xia Guo had previously tribute to the Song Dynasty, and the states and the military along the way had passed. Xia Guoren had a good understanding of the geographical situation of the Song Dynasty, but Song Jun did not understand. Moreover, Li Yuanzhang can&#39;t help but say that he is a genius military strategist. He uses his troops as a god. He is very good at screaming at the West, so the Song army has taken another place. Although the war of the Song Dynasty has won a great victory, the economic benefits have been greatly lost, and it is not worth the loss. If it is possible to talk to the Song Dynasty, of course, it is a good thing. Moreover, the war has exhausted the Xixia national power, the prices have soared, and the people complained that they could not survive. And with this life problem of war, it is famine. After the outbreak of the war, the Song Dynasty stopped its border trade with Xixia. The large amount of daily necessities in Xixia, such as cloth, tea, and grain, could not be self-sufficient. The use of economic sanctions by the Song Dynasty was obvious, and the necessities of life in Xixia were scarce. Therefore, Xixia also hoped to negotiate with the Song Dynasty and get rid of the predicament. Under the mediation of Liao, the two sides negotiated, Song gave the Xixia preferential policy, and Xixia called the Song. Impressed in the warIt was the tolerance and compassion of the Song Dynasty to the soldiers in front. For example, although Liu Ping was defeated and captured, he has fulfilled his responsibility. He has died for the country. There is no hard work and no hard work. There is no hard work and fatigue. The Liuping family is still very generous. There is also Ren Fu, although the defeat is due to the general intention, leading to the defeat of the country, but these generals will die on the battlefield, not afraid of danger, rather than jade, not for the whole, and finally all the country, reflecting the iron and blood of the Central Plains dynasty, so The history books did not praise them. The court did not pursue the defeat of the generals. They all gave nicknames and favored their families. From this, we can also see a broad mind of the Great Song Dynasty established by the nobles. There are many celebrities in the Song Dynasty who fought against Yuan Zhen, such as Fan Zhongyan and Han Qi. However, although the Xixia Dynasty has been established, it is the bottom of the tribal group. In fact, the history of the Three Dynasties, the Khitan or the Jurchen, the party is also, in the process of establishing the country, has never properly solved the problem of a power balance. The royal family was originally one of the many tribes of the ethnic group. It may have a comparative advantage, but it does not occupy an absolute advantage. The original military democratic political legacy of the tribal people still exists. They are not like the Central Plains. The emperor has the world, and it is the family of my family. Long live in the mountains, no one thinks about rebellion, Xixia is different, the party-related ethnicity is divided into several parts, such as Xifeng, Nori, and Tuo, and you can be an emperor, why can&#39;t I be a wild? Why can&#39;t you seal? For a long time, the hidden dangers of the nephews and the powers have been lingering. Of course, the Song Dynasty certainly knew well, so the Great Song used this meticulous and Li Yuanzhangâ€™s suspicion to successfully remove his two generals, Wang Rong and Yu Yu, while he was a queen, plus Yuan Zhen. The occupation of the Prince, and finally led to the tragedy of the Prince Edward, the Yuan Zhen was seriously injured, the Prince was killed by the Quan Chen. Li Xiaozhen, the second generation of Xixia, Emperor Yizong. When Yuan Zhen died, the ministers stepped forward and advocated to act in accordance with Yuan Zhenâ€™s will, and his brother-in-law, Geng Ning, inherited the throne of Xixia, but the national phase did not have a strong opposition. Because of its power, he insisted The children born to his sister are the successors, and other ministers have nothing to say. Li Xiaoyu inherits Datong, his mother does not have a Tibetan family as the Queen Mother, and no Tibetans continue to serve as the kingdom of the country. Xixia Wangquan, there is no one to hide. Yi Zong is less than two years old. As he grows older, he is a rough, one-year-old father, nine-year-old mother, and also trained as a national leader, so he is a man, a strainThe ability is very strong. He wants to take back the regime. Gradually, he began to secretly meet with the ministers who were dissatisfied with the Tibetans, especially the generals with military power. In the end, when he was at the age of fifteen, he did his best and became a pro-government. After Yizong was in power, he did a few things. First, in the year of pro-government, he sent people to return the Song dynasty land that had not been occupied by the Tibetans to the Song Dynasty. Second, restore Hanli. Third, announce the restoration of Liâ€™s name given to the Tang Dynasty. Fourth, the Song Dynasty was asked to marry, but the Song Dynasty refused. However, the Song Dynasty resumed the market on the border and traded with Xixia. These measures were implemented, and the Xixia national power that did not hide the decline of Pangâ€™s political period was gradually restored after Liâ€™s pro-government. Li Xiangyu tried to maintain a balance between the three countries of Song, Liaoning and Xia, and could not completely fall out with the Song Dynasty, but I want to show you that I know my strength. In fact, the Liao and Song Dynasties are also good, and later the Liao and Jin Dynasties, Mongolia, gold, and the Southern Song Dynasty are similar to the relationship between Wei and Wu in the Three Kingdoms period. It should be the union of two weak countries, against the powerful countries, is the self-protection. Tao, Li Fortuniously understands this truth. Li Xiaozhenâ€™s pro-government has not been done for a few years, and he has done a lot of work. He is still a very successful monarch in the history of Xiaguo. Unfortunately, he is not a fake year. He died at the age of twenty-one. Li Bingchang, Xi Xia Yi Zong Li Forg, the son of Xi Xia Hui Zong. Because Li Bing is only eight years old at the time, his mother-in-law, the Empress Dowager, came to the government, which is the first Empress Dowager in the history of Xixia. Although she is a Han Chinese, but after the party is too late, it is not the same family that she has to do more than the party. When Emperor Liang came to power, he announced that all the Chinese measures in the era of Li Xiaoxuan were abolished and the rituals were restored. Then she continued to send troops to attack the border of the Song Dynasty. At this time, the emperor of the Song Dynasty was the Song Shenzong. After Wang Anshiâ€™s reform, the national strength was strong, and the treasury was full, while Xia Guoâ€™s mother and son lost at this time, and the monarch and centrifugal centrifuged, thinking that the opportunity had arrived, fleeting, but launched two times against the summer. The war ended in failure. After the death of Liang Taihou, her niece was a queen, her nephew was a national, and the regime was still in the hands of Liangâ€™s brothers and sisters. She was very depressed and soon went with his mother. When she died, she was twenty-six years old, the second generation of Xixia. The emperor lived twenty-one years old, and the third emperor lived twenty-six years old, all under the pressure of the mother and the outside, and died young. Li Ganshun, the son of Li Bingchang of Xixia Huizong, the fourth emperor of Xixia, Chongzong, was only three years old when he was in the throne. The emperorâ€™s embarrassment was the national phase. The mother was the queen, and the Xixia regime was still in the hands of the Liang family. The Queen Mother at this time is the trabecular Queen Mother. The trabecular queen is sent by the LiaoThe aristocrats who opposed the Xixia against Liangâ€™s dictatorship were poisoned at the state banquet. The tyrannical prince of the tyrannical typhoon died, Chongzong pro-government, he took the reliance on Liao, and with Song repair strategy, develop production, recuperate, martial arts, rehabilitate the national strength suffered severe losses due to the successive years of war, the military power to return to the royal hands The royal powers defeated the post-national forces and the imperial power was consolidated. Chongzong took the Central Plains dynasty and divided the Wang Jue. Among the kings, the king of the king and the king of Shu Wang, the king of the king, the king of the king, the civil and military, the royal power was greatly strengthened. The three princes were in the DPRK, assisting the country in long-term stability, and in the Chongzong era, the ethos of Xixia gradually changed from Shangwu to Chongwen. Emperor Chongzong was bent on seeking treatment and was unwilling to fight again. The best way to do this is to move closer to the Central Plains dynasty in the ideological culture. He resumed the Chinese studies and ordered the two studies of both Shu and Han. The actions of Chongzong conformed to the trend of historical development. They used the opportunity of repairing with the Song Dynasty to recuperate and seek health and make Xixia live a peaceful life for many years. During the Chongzong period, it experienced the demise of Liao and Northern Song Dynasty. Xixia smashed the Northern Song Dynasty and the Song Dynasty moved south. In Shaanxi and Gansu, the area expanded and the territory was getting bigger and bigger. Xixia was very gracious to the Jin Dynasty and tribute a lot of gold and silver. Treasures, the emperor of the Golden State was happy, and rewarded the site of Qinghai to Xia Chongzong. When Chongzong was in power, the area of â€‹â€‹Xia Guo reached its peak, the Northern Song Dynasty perished, Jianyan Nandu, Song Room moved south, Xia He The contradictions between the Songs did not exist, and the two countries were not shackled. The original Song-Xia border became basically the Jinxia border. When Chongzong Li Ganshun was outside, he went to the right and left, and hit the Universiade, making the area of â€‹â€‹Xixia the largest. Chongzong was three years old and reigned for fifty-four years, becoming the most successful monarch in the history of Xixia. Li Renxiao, Xia Renzong, son of Chongzong. When he was in power, Confucianism flourished in the Western Xia, and the national policy also inevitably slipped to the Confucian country. Ren Hyoâ€™s husband can be able to bend and stretch, and he is also a monarch with a great talent. He strengthens the imperial power and consolidates his emperor. Although he has experienced such a thing as a respectable country, with the help of the Golden State, he has managed to slap the task. Respecting the party, its conspiracy to divide the country failed. Externally, he should be soft when he is soft, as long as he is good for Xixia. Moreover, Ren Xiao loves the people very much. When he was in office, Xia Guoâ€™s national strength continued to rise. Ren Xiao was sixteen years old and fifty-four years old. Like his dad, the two men were nearly one hundred and ten years old, and Xixia was only one hundred and ninety years old. Li Chun?, Xia Yuzong, son of Renzong.æ¡“å®—å½“For more than a decade, the emperor has basically followed the established policy of the old man. For more than a decade, the emperor has been stable and has no major events. In the end, he was scrapped by his mother, Empress Luo, and was quickly eliminated. Li security, Xixia Yuzong, Chongzong Sun, Ren Zongxi. In 1206, Li Jingjun was in the throne. Mongolian Genghis Khan had risen to Mobei at this time, completed the unification of the grasslands, and established the Mongolian Khanate to seek conquest. The attacking target pointed to Xixia. Jin Guo refused to send troops to help Xixia, Li security sent troops to attack the Golden State, and the result was no return. In the past year, he was killed by Qi Wang, and died in the same year. He was 42 years old. Li security was in office for six years. During his reign, the Xixia people were very poor, the army was very weak, and political corruption was extremely extreme. Li was safe himself, and he was very corrupt. He indulged in the wine, ignored the political affairs all day, and complained everywhere. Li Zunyi (1163-1226), Xixia Shenzong (reigned from 1211 to 1223), party clan. In March of the 10th year of Tianqing (1203), he took the Western Xia Haishu Imperial Examination and was named the champion. In the second year of Emperor Jian&#39;s (1211), the court coup was launched, and Zong Li was safed. He became the emperor and became the eighth emperor of Xixia. Li Zunyi is the only champion in Chinese history. When Li Zunqi was in office, he lost the war with Mongolia and the Southern Song Dynasty. In the face of such a mess, he abdicated in 1223 and passed it to Li Dewang, the only Taishang Emperor in Xixia. In 1226, he died of illness, and he was the emperor of the English emperor. Li Dewang, the Xixia Xianzong (1181-1226), Li Zunyi second son. When the throne was in 1223, Xixia was already riddled with grief; and Zongli was able to fight the demise of Xixia. He changed his national policy to be the anti-Mongolian, but it was too late. The Mongolian army attacked Xixia in a big way, and all the way to the city was ruined. Xixia suffered heavy losses. In July 1226, he saw the great cause of the disaster in the country, and he died in horror. Li? (?â€”1227), the last emperor of Xixia, the grandson of Li Zunyi of Xixia Shenzong, and the nephew of Li Dewang of Xixia. The sect was amazed and died after the death. In the second year of the reign, the country was killed, and then killed by the Mongolian soldiers. The burial place is unknown. The late Xia Emperor was killed and the Xixia royal family was completely killed. At this point, Xixia was extinct. If it was counted from the Yuan Dynasty, Xixia experienced an emperor, one hundred and nine decades. Among the current 56 ethnic groups in China, there is no party clan. After the demise of the Xixia regime, the greatest possibility of the party-nation nation is to merge with other ethnic groups around it, such as the Han, Tibetan, and Mongolian. In fact, Teacher Yuan told meThe history of Xixia is very simple, but the context is very clear. It is quite good to know the main historical events of the Xia Dynasty. Continue to look at the other two in the future.",movie
760,"The first time I read Feng Dian&#39;s book, in fact, there are some thoughts like online microblogs and logs, but I believe that they are the true words of Feng Dao, and also reflect the true nature of Feng Dao. I read what he said. I know him more about this person, but I like him more. Although his book is very expensive, it is to support him to make better movies. Now I feel that some of these interesting words make a record. &quot;Good heart and good mentality are two different things. People with good intentions don&#39;t necessarily have a mentality, and people with good mentality may not be happy. People with good hearts are not necessarily good psychological quality, people with good psychological quality, and the truth is that bad people are mostly. My psychological quality is very bad, my face is full of anger, even if I am a bad person, I am very incompetent, and I am not qualified for sinister work.&quot; In Feng&#39;s words, my heart is good but my mentality is not good, I can&#39;t do it well. On the contrary, some people who are not very good around them are really fucking good. Feng leads a group of text messages in the New Year. &quot;The message from the SMS business company is full of congratulatory messages, but I can&#39;t see a heartfelt word from a friend&#39;s heart........ I don&#39;t send text messages, I am not interested in these one-size-fits-all things. If I want to celebrate my friend&#39;s New Year, I will call and tell each other personally. This is a sentiment, not a passing.&quot; Not to mention, at this point, I am highly consistent with Feng Dao, and I never send text messages during the Chinese New Year, even if I send text messages. Everyone is tailor-made, not all the same, or call more, convenient and friendly. There is a chapter in this book called Eater, and I understand Feng&#39;s eating habits. Feng guide only eats vegetables for three meals a day. He does not eat meat, seafood does not eat, and the food with the glutinous rice refuses. He especially likes to eat tomatoes, probably related to his childhood. He has the habit of eating late at night, he said: &quot;Long-term stay up all night to develop the habit of eating supper. Staying up late is also very simple, boiled rice and leftovers. Especially like the leftover garlic in the leftovers, the taste, the fragrance. Meal After drinking a glass of lemonade, sip a bit of smoke and relish, beautiful. Since childhood, the family is not rich, the vegetables are salty, so the habit of heavy taste, the most afraid of friends to treat Cantonese cuisine, the children of poor families have made a fortune Will enjoy the film. The film is also affordable.&quot; Such a big director, such a diet, has to be sighed. Speaking of Cantonese cuisine Fengdao said: &quot;The characteristic of eating Cantonese cuisine is that before the meal, the guests are invited to take a look around the fish tank and point out their favorite living things. Then there will be a group of raw seafood and heroic righteousness. The way of execution is also very cruel. .......I have always thought that the Han people are kind and refined, and the Cantonese cuisine is so popular that I discovered that this famous familyIt is also very cruel, and the crimes committed against the weak animals are also terrible and horrible. Feng guides the heart. He has his own feelings about the work and life Feng guide, and the passages in the text are thorough. &quot;After half a year, I finally understand and squat. Playing with yourself, making yourself happy is true, and the rest are all embarrassing. I really don&#39;t understand why the buddies who made the money have not lost their lives in black and white. Is it strong? How much is enough? Can you take it with you? Going to Shanxi for the scenery, I saw more than a dozen hundred-year-old houses. The masters have nowhere to look for them. The keys are all irrelevant.&quot; &quot;I found that as long as I have no ambition, I donâ€™t want to do things, I donâ€™t have to ask for help.&quot; I believe that I will never regret what I have done when I am dying. I will only regret what I didnâ€™t want to do at the beginning (not to rob the bank). I think it may be difficult for me to reach this realm. The first chapter is not reliable. Love reading, Feng Dian said some phenomena are very thought-provoking, and the criticism is also very explicit. When talking about the dirty of Chinatown, Feng said: &quot;You can&#39;t be clean if you care about being seen by people.&quot; This is the minimum of dignity. I often hear people admire a community when they are used to saying &#39;extra foreign.&#39; &quot;There is also talk about education,&quot; the two children are naughty. The teacher&#39;s usual practice is to talk separately and encourage each other to reveal. Whoever betrayed thoroughly will get a wide deal. The consequences of this practice are very serious. He will make the child think that the betrayal of friends can benefit from it, and loyalty will make him fall into desperation. Our elders have already tasted the benefits of change in previous sports, so the national loyalty is greatly reduced. What about our children? Also cultivate their habits and betrayal? We can&#39;t encourage whistle-blowers, no matter how good the reputation, once this habit is formed, then the devils come to the pit but the Eighth Route Army. In the dilemma of betraying friends and lying, my advice to the child is to lie if silence can&#39;t pass. The two evils are taken lightly. It is a last resort to sell a friend. For example: lying is also seen through the knife has been placed around the neck. However, if the knife is smashed, it can&#39;t be done with great deeds. It can only be unlucky to let the head move. Even if the son committed a crime of death, the fact that Laozi sent his son to the guillotine could not be encouraged. Some people still admire the righteousness of the righteousness, but who is the definition of this righteousness? In the Cultural Revolution, his son sold Laozi, and at that time he was called Shenming Dayi. Now it seems that this son is a beast. You killed your enemy, you think you are a righteous, and your enemy calls you a mob. What is wrong? Different positions have opposite conclusions. But youTo sell your loved ones, there is no humanity. Itâ€™s a crime against humanity.â€ Talking about the foreignerâ€™s toll booth is interesting. Fengâ€™s description says, â€œThe rich foreigners still insist on saying â€œHave a good dayâ€ to everyone who is passing by! ....... To be savvy or to say that we are going to tell a few million to hear and have imagination. Care for the tollers, people-oriented. They all say that foreigners are smart, how can they not learn? Think carefully about whether people are stupid or fake. The second chapter Feng introduces a lot of people around him, his mother, his wife Xu Fan, actors Chen Daoming, Shu Qi, Ge You, director Jiang Wen, Zhou Xingchi, real people I feel kind. In the third chapter, Feng Dao talked about fairness. &quot;With regard to fairness, I want to say that opportunities should be fair, but they cannot be equal. I have never been to the film school and have never attended college. Itâ€™s not a pretty director who graduated from college in the past. Fortunately, when the reforms coincided, the film industry broke the threshold and gave me the guidance. This is the fairness of opportunity. But I will never imagine that the results will be flattened. The two carpenters, whoever lives fine, have food to eat. Itâ€™s unfair to have a piece of cake without skill and skill, diligence and laziness. &quot;However, Feng, ah, may be lazy and diligent, it will evenly divide a piece of cake, and may even be divided more. In the fourth chapter, there is an article about Han Hanâ€™s solo group, which tells about a common prostitute in a remote town. Shan. For the children in her stomach, she can kneel in front of people like a dog, letting her trample trample, and defending her sonâ€™s dignity like a wolf. Although she is a poor mother, Feng said that she wants to Han Han expressed his respect. I want to pay tribute to these two people. Also talk about Chongqing, there is a saying in the quote that is called Lao Wang: &quot;In the face of such a scene, all despair can be revived in an instant. Feng guide also said: &quot;Chongqing, you let me just want to go back when I left. &quot;To tell the truth, I also want to go to Chongqing to see it. Talk about the Olympic bid.&quot; In a certain year, Toronto bid for the Olympic Games. Guess what? The people of Toronto rejoiced in the streets to celebrate the failure of the Olympic bid. The reporter interviewed the public: &#39;Why not be depressed? &#39;The public smiles on the face, A: Our normal life can finally be disturbed. This incident shows that the talents who have just lived a good life in the family are eager to open their homes and swear. Show off. I still feel inferior in my bones and I look down on people. Should be stretched, can&#39;t do two things, love can&#39;t come. &quot;&quot; Mr. Gao Yuanzhang, the originator of Shandong Fast Book High School, once told his disciples, know whyDo you have any porcelain in your life? Because you have not had to eat. The words are very shallow and the truth is not shallow. &quot;I feel very deep in this passage.&quot; &quot;It is understandable to harm others and benefit others. It is harmful to others and their hearts are dirty. This is called viciousness.&quot; I was confused before, how can people be so bad? After I finished &quot;1942&quot;, I found the answer. This is the place in the womb, and the inheritance is orderly. &quot;I think this is the inferiority of the people of the country. &quot;When you listen, everyone loves to listen better than you, but don&#39;t be intoxicated when you kidnap.&quot; &quot;This is to say that the &quot;Non 2&quot; crew on a TV show allowed the participating stars to sing a song and praise the Feng guide. Feng Dao does not like it, but in reality many people like it. The text uses a lot of space to introduce him to shoot. Some things in 1942, such as Feng Dao, told them to go out and interview an old lady named Liu Heping, who passed the disaster. She witnessed the desperate disaster, and she went to life to kill her dying child. I also described a thing related to eating. It was her fellow countryman who was on the road to fleeing. She was so hungry that she was mad and fainted on the side of the road. Suddenly she felt a sharp pain, opened her eyes, and was shocked. Another victim used a sickle to cut a piece of meat on his ass. The fellow villager shouted: I am still in the middle! Don&#39;t eat me! The victims of the meat cut said: You are not in the middle, save me. This kind of person eats people. Things, we heard shocking, but Liu Hepingâ€™s old man was indifferent. She said: There are too many people starving to death. There are also things about shooting, our film industry is really too backward, and many things need to be done by foreigners. and also Robbins, one of the main stars, said: It is not difficult to write the darkness of human nature. The most difficult thing is to write hope in the darkness. Shawshank is the two words &quot;hope.&quot; It is too incisive to read Shawshank three times. These two words. This book says there are 120,000 words, but I feel that Feng has cut corners and cut a lot of blank pages, but many of the paragraphs inside are very interesting. These are just some of them. The life experience of these high-level people is also one. Let&#39;s learn, and I will have the opportunity to look at other books by Feng and continue to support Feng Dian&#39;s film.",movie
761,"November is definitely a time for the Internet, because the home appliance dealers are busy fighting for the online shopping season of Singles. However, not only is there a fierce battle in the commercial war on the Internet, but also a very cool and violent commercial war in the cinema, so that we can see the brutality and coldness of the commercial war from the perspective of the onlookers, and this can be seen. The &quot;commercial warfare&quot; will be launched in the movie &quot;Shengsheng Password&quot; released on the 8th! Speaking of the movie &quot;Synonym Password&quot;, this is a fairly high-end movie with low-key luxury and connotation. The reason why the high-end atmosphere is high is because the commercial warfare described in the film is a big coffee with over 10 billion funds, and it is also involved in Wall Street, Swiss Bank, Interpol and even the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. The mysterious department is so astounding. As for his low-key luxury, there is a connotation, but also because this film also contains reflection on human nature, let us see the darkest side of human nature to abandon family love for the sake of profit. Therefore, it can be said that the twin password is a movie that is highly high in height and deep in depth. The film tells that when the financial tsunami spread to the world, Hong Kong billionaire Luo Jiaying&#39;s company was promoted by Sun Xing by Steve. He was annexed by despicable means. However, Luo Jiaying had already left behind for himself? That is most of his property. In fact, there are tens of billions of cash in Swiss banks. The electronic password of the money is stored in the crystal U disk necklace worn by her daughter Ling Dan. Because it requires two passwords to unlock and withdraw the money, the title of &quot;small password&quot; is available. In fact, Luo Jiaying himself is not a profiteer imagined by the outside world, but a conscience businessman who has robbed the rich and helped the poor. For this reason, his murder also caused investigations of Steve&#39;s illegal acts by relevant departments... So all kinds of people waited for the debut, and a commercial war revenge drama opened! Of course, it is not only the scenes in the film that the &quot;Senior Password&quot; is high-end atmosphere, but also the film is very appealing and influential from the story, the main creation to the actor configuration. The film&#39;s production team not only has a team of consultants from Hollywood, but also a filmmaker from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Taiwan to create a suspense movie for urban action. The scene is even across Asia, Europe and the Americas, and has a very international perspective. Among them, there are many elements such as commercial warfare, love, gun battles, movements, suspense, vigilance, and spy warfare, which makes people look refreshed. In addition, the film&#39;s cast configuration is also very international. apart fromIn addition to the old drama of Hong Kong film representative Luo Jiaying and Taiwanese film representative Sun Xing, there is also a powerful tough guy from Ji Feilong, which provides quality assurance for the film.

762,"When I was a freshman, I participated in a debate. It should be the only one without accident. The topic is very socialist: whether the horse should eat it or not. Because it is a new debate, and basically no classmates understand, so as the squad leader, I and the two members of the groupâ€™s branch secretary have two other students who have just pulled over, so they set up the grass team, with the help of two sophomore sisters. I was in touch with the debate. I prepared materials, drafts, revisions, manuscripts, revisions, and manuscripts all night long.

You need to prepare all night, read a lot, fight yourself in your mind, present your own theory and attack yourself, and keep your mind in a tight state. You have to think about the ugliness that you know can&#39;t solve but actually exist. In the dark, you have to maintain everything you hate. But it is those things that make us feel sick and want to spit out, and have taught us the most. Many people will wonder why they want to debate, because you know that even if you win, you can&#39;t change anything. You can&#39;t even change the opponent you defeated. He will still stick to his own point of view. But, most importantly, the debate has changed yourself, and this is where his most important meaning lies.

764,"The movie tells a ghost. The male and female protagonists are a couple, and the two are very loving. The hero is working in a financial enterprise, and the heroine is an artist. One day, after watching the comedy, the two men encountered robbers on their way home and the male lead was shot. Thus, the actor became a ghost 5, but she was reluctant to leave the heroine, and she was around her life. When the male lead was in the heroine&#39;s home, the robber who killed himself suddenly broke in, and it was he who knew he was murdered. After the male protagonist used the run to scare and robbed, he followed him back home, and then he told the heroine to let her go to the police. In this way, the actor found a black woman who would be psychic, and the black woman decided to come to the heroine. Although the heroine did not believe in her letter, she went to the police station to report the police, but the police did not believe it. Later, the heroine told the actor&#39;s good friend, which made the good friend very scared. After the good friend left, he rushed to take the robbery house. The original male protagonist was killed by a good friend. A few days later, a good friend still wants to go to the heroine to have a relationship. This makes the actor who knows the truth very angry, but he has nothing to do, but he has to ask other ghosts to teach himself to touch objects. After a while, the actor learned. Subsequently, the actor found a black woman, let her help the good friends have always tried to grasp the huge amount of money, so that the good friends suddenly collapsed. In the evening, a good friend came to the heroine, and the actor taught him. Good friends know that everything is planned by the actor. So, after the good friend left the heroine&#39;s house, he went to kill the black woman with the robbers. In this way, after some chasing and fighting, good friends and robbers are killed. Finally, the heroine saw the actor who became the angel, crying and watching him leave. This movie is very classic, I have seen it many times. I saw it in the 1990s, I saw it in the first decade of the 21st century, and now I see it again in the second decade. However, this film is very beautiful no matter how many times it is viewed. Because it has novel plots, nice music, beautiful pictures and cola laughter, even if the less perfect effect in the film is not outdated today, let alone the film&#39;s description of love aesthetics and romance. ! In short, this film is a very interesting and very touching love classic, it is not high at the box office. Probably analyze, this film combines multiple types of films. First of all, the protagonist is a ghost, so part of the film is very horror-like; secondly, the psychic black woman is full of laughter, so it is a comedy film; third, there are special effects in the film, there areHeaven&#39;s hell is divided, so it can also be regarded as a magical film; fourth, there is a actor with a good friend to buy a murderous bridge, this is a gangster; fifth, the movie as a whole is a romantic romance. In summary, it can be seen that this is a mix and match of various styles of film, to meet the needs of a variety of viewing people, but also allows the majority of viewers to feel the thrill of a variety of movies in a movie. Can a movie with such a high price/performance ratio look bad? In addition, the details in the film are also done very well. For example, the hero and the protagonist say &quot;I love you&quot;, the male and female protagonists understand each other, and so on. Especially the way the male and female protagonists say &quot;I love you&quot; has left a deep impression on me. I have remembered it for nearly two decades! It can be seen that a good movie can have a great impact on people, even with a lifetime. The film was very flamboyant and beautiful. The most classic of the film is the scene when the &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; male and female protagonists play pottery. It has become a permanent memory of a generation: this scene represents romance. In addition, the various stalwart buildings and classical decoration styles in the film give the film a unique style. New York in the late 1980s and 1990s is a unique city. Now these scenes have probably been covered by electronic things. But writing here reminds me that New York is also a city where criminals are rampant, otherwise how can the male lead die? As for the theme of the movie, there is no need to say more, that is, true love is invincible, and it is sure to defeat the dark and evil forces. At the same time, the film also told the audience that people will really go to heaven or go to hell after death, and can&#39;t do bad things when they are alive! In addition, the love of this film is too perfect, which makes the heroine how to live in the future. When the male protagonist leaves with a halo, can the heroine have the mood to find a new man? The unfortunate actress, was written to write to the road! The actors are colored. The performances of the actor Patrick Swayze and the actress Demi Moore are very exciting. It is really not easy for the film to be a lot of emotions. The supporting role Whoopi Goldberg performed equally well, and the jokes in the film came from her, winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Everyone else is a dragon, not to mention it. in conclusion. A good-looking, funny, touching classic love movie that can be used to relive when you don&#39;t believe in love.

765,"This film is the 48th part of the 2005 Hong Kong Film Awards Association Chinese Film Best 100. The film tells the implicit love between a pair of men and women who are secretly in love. In the small town, the male lead sells buns, and the heroine helps the relatives to do housework. Because the male and female protagonists are neighbors, the two like each other, but they have no confession. Therefore, although the male and female protagonists are closely related, there are still some distances. One day, the actor couldnâ€™t bear to endure the gangsters who had eaten the tyrants, insulting the gangsters. Therefore, the gang boss went out to write a book in the middle of the night, going to the actor to settle accounts. After the male protagonist went to the appointment, he was seriously injured by the gangster. The heroine took him home and tried to take care of it, but she had to leave. Because the heroine&#39;s family has already found a good man for her, she has to go home and go to the family. After the body of the hero recovered, he did not know the truth. He looked forward to the heroine every day, until he heard that the heroine had married. At the same time, borrowing money from the actor to kiss the neighbors, the wife who came back is very capable, opened a restaurant and robbed most of the business of the actor, so that the business of the leading actor fell. Subsequently, the actor who borrowed money to lend again suffered a shipwreck, making his own blood, this incident also prompted the male lead brother to die. After a period of time, the block where the male lead opened the store will be demolished by the government. All this makes the male lead homeless and can only borrow a friend&#39;s home. However, at this time, the heroine took the child suddenly and gave hope to the life of the male lead. The husband of the heroine had died in a car accident. In this way, the male and female protagonists resold the oil cake together, and their lives gradually improved. After a while, the actor rented a house, and the two also expressed their own thoughts. Finally, the two cried and hugged together. This is a very plain movie. I can&#39;t say good or bad. A small town, a pair of men and women, a relationship, this is the whole movie, so simple can not be simpler. The content of the film is also ordinary. It is a trivial life like laundry, borrowing money, selling steamed buns, selling oil cakes, and the like. It is very life-like. So, this is not a gripping movie, nor a film that causes thinking, just a realistic movie that shows life. That is to say, through the movie story, the Taiwanese peopleâ€™s simple and simple life, as well as the excessive love between men and women. To sum up briefly, it is a movie that reflects reality and a movie that describes love. Itâ€™s just that I have seen too many films like this, and I canâ€™t touch me anymore. The film was shot on the ordinary, simple and warm, and did not reflect Li HanxiangqiangStrong personal style. Other aspects of the filming are not too much because the picture is too bad. Now I want to talk about the poor quality of this film! Itâ€™s terrible! How bad is the picture? The image is slanted, the color is gray, the scale is distorted, and the worst is the lack of the bottom right corner of the entire full picture! The film is like a pirated gun movie. It seems that the repair of the Taiwanese film is not so good. It is similar to the mainland, and it is half a catty. The actor is ordinary. But the young, pure and beautiful Yalei in the film is so cute, in the present words, it is &quot;meng&quot;. I didnâ€™t think that when I was young, Gui Yalei was quite charming, and the woman was wonderful! The rest of the film is quite satisfactory, but they are not red, and it is difficult to find their relevant information on the Internet, so I will not say it. in conclusion. This is a movie that is not ugly and not good-looking. It is as plain as water, and it is not an excellent movie. [å†¬æš–].The Winter.1969.VCDRip.640x364.x264.ac3.jyt",movie

The story is obviously ideal and romantic, a game from childhood to big dare, how many crazy and absurd sweet bitterness has gone with the wind; but this game has only big adventures, no truth, even if they love each other, even in I have slept for a few years on a bed, but no one wants to go half a step. Is it too serious to enter the play? Is it impossible to distinguish between friendship and love? Is it afraid to break the status quo and can&#39;t look back?

The confession in the rain is the climax and the end point, so two people who are not in line with the world will turn their love into eternity in the city&#39;s steel and concrete. Some people say that the film is an open end, burning to death or white-headed, by the readers themselves. But the name of the fourth act of the film (&quot;the last game&quot;) and the last half of the box in the cement that echoed the beginning actually showed the true ending. The color of the old-age image was obviously blue, suggesting that it was not reality; and the kissing of the two men in each period of the flashback did not match the previous plot. This is the ideal situation of two people (or the audience), two small and no guesses, each other, sweet words, still playing the game when you are old. In the 1940s and 1950s, the French national treasure singer Ã©dith Piaf&#39;s masterpiece &quot;Rose Life&quot; was the theme song throughout the film. The little girl in the film sang in the cemetery, appeasing the pain of the young boy&#39;s loss of the mother; the actor at the end of the film used it to confess in the rain, so that the two people&#39;s points would be combined into a positive result. Coincidentally, the heroine Marion Cotillard performed the life of Ã©dith Piaf in the French film &quot;The Life of Roses&quot; four years later, and swept the best actresses of the major awards. This film is the debut of the French director Yann Samuell, but it is also the peak. Later, he took several films and couldn&#39;t compliment him. The lead actor Guillaume Canet is not handsome, but very talented, able to play the guide, and also won the Caesar Award for the best director.

Golden Horse International Film Festival NETPAC Best Asian Film Awards, and won the fifth FIRST Young Film Festival five awards. Of course, this movie also made me see the folk art of the duo. At first, it was attracted by the movie poster. At that time, I only knew that it was the award-winning work at the Golden Horse Film Festival. I thought it was an ordinary literary film. I really didn&#39;t expect it to be &quot;rough&quot; compared to the poster. The eroticism displayed in the posters is actually not related to the film, but only the propaganda. Because such a literary film with a strong local flavor, if there is no publicity, it is estimated that few people are willing to buy tickets. In addition to the heroine Ye Lan, the rest of the actors are amateur. This professional actor is really powerful, one person is decorated with a triangle (the beautiful sister and the big woman three women), if I don&#39;t look at the cast, I have not found the same person. Iron Egg&#39;s love is like the sprouting of young desires in &quot;The Beautiful Legend of Sicily&quot;, rooting and sprouting...

However, the US sister does not seem to want her daughter to be with the iron egg. The big woman married the nomadic man. The iron egg is as gray as the compensation. As a compensation, he took two women, but he did not love her. Living away from home, he met three women, and the resurgence in his heart revived. However, he was bound by ethics and morality, and he could only stop. Three women, one who loves each other but marry others, one who has no love sparks with him but who is with him, the last one is obsessed with him, but he has no help. The beautiful sister is like an invisible line pulling the emotional life of the iron egg, and glaring at him for a lifetime. Love is extravagant. In the end, it is necessary to return to normal life. The iron egg holds his niece. He may understand what his wife and children are. Off-topic, as the iron egg&#39;s pursuit of art, the literary film is the most box-free guarantee in all types of films. In the movie, the duo will eventually be equipped with pop culture to make a living, and art can&#39;t continue if it is supported by money. Therefore, it is not easy to say that it is a movie poster. Popular science knowledge: &quot;two people&quot; as aThe opera dramas popular in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the northern regions of Shanxi, Shaanxi and Hebei provinces have been part of Chinese national culture since the beginning of their creation.

In my opinion, the film was very successful, and it has improved a lot of levels compared to the straightforward story that the death squad can guess from the beginning. The plot is based on jailbreak. Whether the tough guys such as Stallone and Arnold can handle the high IQ scales, should the action of careful judgment and astronomical geography analysis become a fist. They did speak with their fists, and they also took good care of the tone of the high IQ film. Stalloneâ€™s help every time was a prelude to the dry frame, very rough and very clever to solve the problem. The film is very rich in topic. After watching the movie, you can ridicule with friends. &quot;I need you to help me,&quot; because there is nothing good to call for help every time. Finally, I feel that even though Arnold and Stallone are 60 years old, they still have enough charm. Stallone and the guards are single-handedly tough.

Then, the disciple invited the girl to take care of the elderly. When the girl was busy with the dance at the time of the old man, let the old man&#39;s exhausted soul re-emerge with youthful agility. The old man is imagining the romantic and happy scene of young and young girls and young girls, inspiring an infinite creative torrent, and writing a short story &quot;Silver Jiao&quot; in a box. This novel was sneaked by the disciples, and it was published for publication. One night, the disciplesâ€™ reputation was unprecedented, and they also won the heavyweight literature award. The lingering of Yin Jiao and his disciples, who did not know the truth, was discovered by the old man. The old man designed a disciplinary student who was tempted to murder the emotional intelligence, and he was regained his love. The film was directed and directed by Korean director Zheng Yuyu.

Actor Award. If the film is the Korean version of Lolita, there is no such thing as a heavy taste in the West. After being subtled by the Eastern culture, it has been improved into a moderate story, and there is no loss of incest. It can be seen that the director Zheng Yuyu is very good at the audience&#39;s psychology and censorship system, and he also tries his best to express the poetic and beautiful romantic feelings, the purity of the girl, the elegance of the poet, the poetic bamboo house, the delicate tenderness and the flying mind. ..... are all showing the beauty of this once &quot;forbidden book&quot; story. Thus, the viewers are divided into two waves. One wave of people sees innocence, and one wave of people sees eroticism. As for the true eroticness of the film, or how innocent it is, it depends on the self-cultivation of the audience.

778,"For director Fang Gangliang, filming &quot;My Shadow is Running&quot; is not that difficult. Fortunately, in his personal interpretation, he called himself a person with little ambition and did not pay attention to the trend around him. The implication is that he is very clear about his current situation and positioning. The film that shoots this pattern and has a small budget is suitable for him. Children with autism, growth, mother and child are in love. In fact, there are so many keywords, &quot;My shadow is running&quot; is easy to be smashed, and it is more likely to be a flood of abuse. Hey. Similar topics, too much jade. Moreover, the audience will inevitably take it for granted. The mother&#39;s love is fascinating, and it is a dream. The child suddenly wakes up and walks out of the new world. As a result, these things that are taken for granted are basically not in the movies. Since the film is composed entirely of hand-held and follow-up lenses, the pursuit of realistic style, the audience plays a special existence in this film. Compared with the general movie, they are closer to the movie characters, almost the invisible people living in the family. Fang Gangliang did not let the actors make up, did not make lighting requirements, tried to make life as much as possible, and the story scene did not add too much decoration, thus achieving the film aesthetics he wanted to pursue, simple and simple. According to his words, such a real thing, he is most afraid of the audience watching and thinking which place is fake. For him, this is the biggest failure of the film. Therefore, many people describe their feelings like this, and it is difficult to enter at first, and slowly begin to accept, and finally suddenly open. In this movie, the reality is so dull, low-key and true that once it enters the child&#39;s perspective, there is a fisheye or a deformed world, and the color is gorgeous. This too obvious contrast processing is of course intentional. In reality, the child is an abnormal person, but in the world after image processing, he sees more colors, richer details and mystery than ordinary people. His eyes are magnifying glasses, and like infrared scanners, this magical filter world, it becomes a special technique of &quot;My Shadow is Running.&quot; However, with these, it is still impossible to make the film really look good. Filling the whole movie is such a trivial matter: the kindergarten hides itself, the attention in class can not be concentrated, and all kinds of special things are done... As a result, the mother helps him wipe his butt and apologizes. In the child&#39;s view, it is not only natural for the mother to do this, but even he feels annoyed and hates his own world being invaded by any outsider. For straightening, the mother is not a mother, she is Tian Guifang. This title has a sense of distance,It is also a manifestation of autism. This mother is much harder than the average mother. She spends almost all of her time on the child, and the wind comes in the rain. So, we see that the film presents a process of mutual search, rather than giving up treatment or forced treatment. At the beginning of the end is the airport passage, straight away from the airport, looking for Tian Guifang to go. Apart from these two places, Tian Guifang was looking for him during most of the film. This search process echoes the shadows and runs in the title. &quot;My shadow is running&quot; is not a general melodrama. There is no climactic conflict. I don&#39;t have to solve the bell. For example, if I am confronted with classmates bullying, I get help from anyone. If there is such a thing, it is too artificial. The whole movie is about the mother and the son, nothing else. Even with the intrusion of uncles and fathers, the clues are evidence of the mother&#39;s emotions, rather than the critical considerations of morality and ethics. But it is not to say that the film will be foolproof. Perhaps many people will feel that the movie is boring and they cannot afford to raise their spirits. Behind this unintentional look and feel, it is not the reality of autism in reality. Compared with normal people, autistic patients are more sensitive and care more about the surrounding area. All the subtle words, they will uncontrollably exaggerate and enlarge, forming a vicious circle. In fact, there are so many people who care about the lives of others, but once someone looks different from the people around them, then trouble and pressure will catch up. In my opinion, &quot;My Shadow is Running&quot; has one of the most valuable places. It is to shape autistic patients from the front, no self-pity, and no sympathy for the audience. The thing it has to say is very simple. An autistic child can grow up healthily, leave the family, and go abroad to study. Even if he did a lot of outrageous things, he didnâ€™t know how to say â€œgratefulnessâ€ (even if his parentsâ€™ love was not rewarding), but he grew up like that for seventeen years. Even in many cases, you will feel that this movie is as self-contained as this child, regardless of whether or not you are immersed in the world that belongs to them. Can you jump out and see, isn&#39;t this the biggest achievement of this movie? Assuming that the director has more premeditated and chasing, then, &quot;My Shadow is Running&quot; will not be like this, but another &quot;Ocean Paradise&quot;, which requires the packaging of big stars, requires the appeal of public welfare and sings. .

779,"First of all, you must openly tell the friends you want to see. This movie is objectively speaking, it is really between the poor and the poor. Of course, I personally feel more inclined to the poor side. . So, the watercress is as high as 8 points, and there are 60 people voting. What is the situation? I personally speculate on which bean friend should have a prominent role in the movie, or as a producer. Then there are a bunch of friends coming to cheer. The film itself is actually quite honest. It is really a desperate place in the lonely sea room. There are really many good and terrible monsters! ! The biggest problem I feel about this movie is that the opening is completely unopened. I really don&#39;t know if the director is looking for an entry point. Generally speaking, this kind of film, at the very least, you have to tell the story of the story. And this movie, what kind of environmental protection organization came up to invade a very poor security company, I really don&#39;t know what it is? ! In this way, in the spirit of the squid, it is better to retreat to the principle of positive and upward, the film should start like this: a well-known international university auditorium is full, a famous female science is doing a clean The important speech on pollution and protection of the earth, the speech was quite successful. In a cheering voice, the female boyfriendâ€™s boyfriend sent a piece of â€œbuy a watch last yearâ€. It turned out to be the birthday of the female subject, in the boyfriendâ€™s birthday. Under the joint effect of conscience, the female section has decisively joined a green environmental protection organization. This environmental protection organization has made many outstanding contributions to saving the earth from home looting. Recently, this environmental organization has been eyeing a super bad guy. That is, an oil company has discovered that the oil company is making a lot of money, but the incident of polluting nature is doing countless, how can environmental organizations be able to let this Is the guy rampant? ! The group of environmental protection organizations naturally included the female section and her boyfriend. They used various high-tech and violent means to sneak into the oil company. However, they happened to hit the oil company and did a weekend cleaning. However, the two fists are hard to beat, and the environmental protection organizations are losing ground. Many people have been overthrown by the temporary workers of the oil company. The female section and her boyfriend are also dangerous. At the last moment, the female section is The opportunity to leave the birth to her boyfriend, decisively sacrificed to the tiger, was caught by the boss of the oil company. The oil company directly sent other small miscellaneous mixes of environmental protection organizations to the public security organs, but only brought the female subjects into the conference room and carried out a deep and profound understanding.Engraving education, the female section left tears of five emotions and six senses. It turned out that she found that the environmental organizations she joined had not done anything beneficial to nature except for disorder and destruction, and the oil company CEOs were still female. When I was a loyal fan of the speech, there was now a big project to remove oil pollutants. She needed a female subject to use her intelligence, so the two hit it off. What is this big project? It is to cultivate a kind of creature that can treat petroleum pollutants as food and has no side effects at all. The only drawback is that the speed is slow. Now only the female department needs to invent an enzyme. Speed â€‹â€‹up this process just fine! The above is the beginning of the movie. The alien shape comes from the creatures that eat oil pollutants after the excessive enzymes. The quantitative change leads to the qualitative change. This monster becomes super huge! ! And in addition to pollutants, I prefer to eat meat! ! ! Through this film, I found another truth. As long as one thing likes to eat human flesh, or if the quantity is huge, if it is too large, the clever humans will start various tragedies! In the process of the film, in fact, I feel that many people are still very careful in the production, the real shape of the real thing, as well as the technical female mechanical mechanic and super muscle man, this combination I like. What I can&#39;t figure out is that the female subject is the inventor of the creature. Why can&#39;t we use a little mind to deal with the aliens? We must know that everything has weaknesses. Can we think about it except for the east? What about Dingâ€™s way? ! In addition, the conflict setting of the three parties is quite interesting, but unfortunately the contradiction is not properly grasped, and if you can join a little armed person, to fight and kill, the effect should be better! !",movie
780,"Historically, love movies have been mostly described by young lovers, supplemented by the results of the retrogression, the final result, the yin and yang, or the comedy such as &quot;Love for 33 Days&quot;, or the tragedy such as &quot;The Five Stolen year&quot;. The film &quot;I Love You Love Me&quot; starring Zhang Hanyu and Wang Weidan changed his vitality and became a concern for the middle-aged male love marriage world. Cutting into love from the perspective of middle-aged men is not common in Chinese movies. Youth love, mostly for the power, distance, secular and other power obstacles, to break through these obstacles, become the driving force behind the promotion of the film story. And &quot;I love you, love me&quot;, the male protagonist has already achieved success in middle age, hindering the power of youth love, and it does not constitute a force. On the contrary, secular things such as career, money, status, etc. become convenient conditions for them to quickly acquire the love of women. Under such convenience, the pain of middle age and uncle is born. After the middle age, it is a successful career, and it is easy to get women&#39;s favor, but in all kinds of favors, it is difficult to choose what you really need. The uncle&#39;s pain is facing the youth&#39;s love and sex in the body and spirit of middle age. Although he is still interested, he will not be able to do so. The movie starring Wang Xiaodan corresponds to Zhang Hanyuâ€™s uncle, who uses the age difference to create contradictory points, thus highlighting the emotional world that middle-aged men are entangled. In terms of love, the Chinese have already broken through the words of their parents. Therefore, the love tragedies like Xixiang and Honglou are gone forever. Love is reasonable, marriage is free, and it becomes a mainstream value. In the face of this freedom, the economic situation of a love partner has become the biggest force to limit it. In the confrontation between freedom and anti-freedom, there is still love drama. However, the middle-aged boss has undoubtedly entered a kind of absolute freedom of love, seemingly lost any restrictions. This absolute freedom makes Zhang Hanyu&#39;s role lose the freedom of the emotional world. The change of women in the representation is in stark contrast to the inability to place the heart in the spiritual world. The film undoubtedly seized this point and made a big fuss. Uncle&#39;s thoughts are mature, but his behavior is detained. It just needs the lively and free decoration of the chick. However, the closeness of this kind of thinking between men and women can only be used as an embellishment and adjustment. Once it becomes mainstream, it will inevitably encounter the resistance of the uncle. The film looks at these essential issues, so that after the &quot;return&quot;, &quot;Wang Yudan&quot; is moving toward &quot;mature&quot;. Zhang Hanyuâ€™s calm and restrained acting skills undoubtedly add a lot to the film. The expression of Wang Shudanâ€™s &quot;making a woman&quot; is no less than &quot;I want to be with you&quot;.Ni Ni&#39;s noisy modality. There are dramas and conflicts, but there is no ending and conclusion. It is undoubtedly the biggest feature of the movie &quot;I love you love me.&quot; Can Uncle and Chick make a positive result? The film did not give an answer, but let the uncle in the play continue to search. This is an artistic gesture of the film creator, because the creator does not know what the future will be. In the final search and delusion, the middle-aged love world is tragically presented. This is also the main value of the film.

781,"After going to the Yuanmingyuan, I went to the bookstore outside and saw the book. I suddenly felt like I wanted to buy it. I want to hear the old manâ€™s words. I also want to see Ni Pingâ€™s book. To be honest, itâ€™s really Watching her show grow up. This book is mainly a story between Ni Ping&#39;s memories and awkwardness. It tells the wisdom life of an ordinary, illiterate old lady. I think that is wisdom. In the opening chapter, Bai Yansong is very good. &quot;A person with academic qualifications does not necessarily have a culture. People who have no education, not necessarily have no culture.&quot; No education, no work, but it is indeed a person with culture and wisdom, one does not recognize The old lady of the word has been reading the big book of life all her life. She is a hard-working student. She is a woman who works hard. In Ni Ping&#39;s narrative, the image of this embarrassment is gradually outlined. He should be a believer, but she does not believe that Buddhism does not believe in Christ. She believes in her own family. When Ni Ping said: &quot;Hey, how many family members, how many children, when you finally walked, you are not alone? Who can take the family with you?&quot; He replied: &quot;Walk in batches, just like batches. I have come together in the same place, and I have come together early and late.&quot; I think this is a comfort and a belief. I always believe that everyone in the next life is still a family. This is her infinite love for her family and her interpretation of life. . For this family she paid a lifetime. Ni Ping was sick and had a high fever. He put her on the sputum and squatted it from head to toe. The fever was standing up, and sweating was more than Ni Ping. But Qilian is not willing to get sick, afraid to give people trouble. When I am old, I am over 90 years old. I have to take a shower. Everyone who cherishes the family, she said: &quot;With people, there is everything......... expensive things can&#39;t keep up with people.&quot; I know the truth of home and everything, even though Ni Ping and her mother sometimes don&#39;t Harmony, but in her life, she also digs in front of Ni Ping to list her mother&#39;s love for her. She said: &quot;The more love is, the more love is a bank. If you are not afraid of spending money, you will not be saved.&quot; Ni Ping divorced from his parents, followed his mother and his sister, and had little contact with his father. However, he said that his father was always positive and he was very concerned about his father. In Ni Ping&#39;s mother&#39;s description, Dad is too bad. He described that Dad is too good. Ni Ping&#39;s brother and sister are trustworthy, so the father in his heart is kind, honest, and high, just because he is not in harmony with his mother. The good qualities of tolerance, tolerance, and tolerance are given to the next generation bit by bit. Kind home makes peopleLearning will not hate, learning will not retaliate, learning will not be a whole person, rule people, is this not much wealth? For Ni Pingâ€™s inauguration, the sad sorrow did not blame the people, but said: â€œWhen the soldiers are the ones, the state has finished the shackles, and those who have a good life, the country has finished the act of being a mother. Followed by the light. å’± This is a bad mother&#39;s life, the country is finished, it is finished. This is true. This is really the heroic words of the heroic mother. I donâ€™t eat a full meal in my life, donâ€™t go to court, donâ€™t talk big, and everyone has strengths in the blink of an eye. He often said: &quot;Whether you can&#39;t figure it out, you can&#39;t think about it. If you can&#39;t get used to it, you can get used to it.&quot; You Chong is not selfish, advocating tolerance, tolerance is to give others a way, take a step back. . The article describes that there is a family who is willing to report the enemies, but he said that it is not necessary to remember to hate her, she hates herself enough. People betrayed their conscience and got a heart attack, and their heartbeat stopped and panicked. There is no wrong thing, no cost, and no good thing is not to get good news. I hope that human affairs and blasphemy are the same, but I think this is one of the secrets of longevity. He is definitely a strong person. She said: &quot;Itâ€™s dark when itâ€™s a big trouble, you have to admit it. You are not squatting, you are biting your teeth, itâ€™s going to dawn. The dawn is giving You hope, you will hurry up and go forward, how far is it going to go forward, God will help you. Don&#39;t spend it in the dark, exhausted the gods, the day is gone. Child, you remember, good things come, she will say hello in advance, bad things will slap you on the head, never notice you in advance, can be more and more strong, can not be suddenly Ni Pingâ€™s son suffered from congenital cataract. Although he did not know that it was an anecdote, he Ni Ping: â€œChildren, you donâ€™t fall, you can pass; you fall, no one can afford you. At the same time, I also advised Ni Ping: &quot;How much sin will be sinned, how much sin will be sinned, and blessing will come back.&quot; In fact, I think that Ni Pingâ€™s son is a physical illness, not fatal, what my child has experienced. I am more trouble than her, I have received it, thank you, these words are straight. My heart, I want to be able to say what you can say. This kind of person is a person who is diligent, hardworking, willing to be self-satisfied, not afraid of hardship. He is a person who works hard and persists in moving forward. He dares to surpass others, dare to defeat himself, and dare to admit. One&#39;s own mistake, someone who dares to face the achievements of others. He said: &quot;What can people do?Yes, waste is not done. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a waste before I become a capable person. I am also a self-reliant person. She said: &quot;Rely on the mountains and the mountains. You will find it when you rely on it. Finally, you rely on yourself. &quot;God and yourself are one person.&quot; Do you think that the anecdote is not the old day in your own heart? Therefore, how much Fuduo&#39;s suffering is made by himself, and no one complains. &quot;Oh, the mentality of the embarrassment is very balanced. She said: &quot;Sorry is reserved specifically, or there is no such word.&quot; &quot;Balance is the axis in my heart. What we lack is often such a balance. Unsatisfied, dissatisfied, mad, violent, cowardly, depressed, and discouraged. Isn&#39;t it because you can&#39;t master your own balance? Expectations about life.&quot; High, confidence in the days is too low, because there is no living star. What is the singularity of the singer? Acceptance, bitterness and sweetness, poverty and wealth are accepted; accepting and not accumulating, actively facing, Ni Ping, they are used to the balance of shackles, so they unconsciously balance the contradictions in their work and the trivial things in life. After a long time, everything becomes natural, and everything becomes a matter of course. Others, the most important thing is that in the collective is not the most annoying person, it is a person who can be trusted. Ni Ping&#39;s previous generation is such a person, they are also such people, I think this is the wealth that they give them. Although I have not studied psychology, I also know the importance of psychological adjustment. Ni Ping complained to her that she was not happy with her mother. She never interrupted, and Ni Ping cried and she followed it. Ni Ping and the smile she ha ha, &quot;anger, and resentment have to say it just fine, regardless of the true really wrong, do not keep, to stay long day on the long body. &quot;In her most primitive way, she combed Ni Ping&#39;s curvy heart. I know that the body is more important than money. She said: &quot;Children, how rich they are, are not young and wealthy.&quot; The young wealthy is that the arms are the arms, the legs are the legs, and the age is rich and wealthy? The eyes are also spent, the teeth are crisp, and the whole body is poor. Some of the money is that you can be poor. &quot;å§¥å§¥ is also a person who does not forget the grace. The warmth of some small things is accumulated in her heart and affects her descendants. Therefore, they feel that they owe a lot of people from their hearts, they are grateful, and they are apologetic, and people will not dare to publicize. I donâ€™t dare to learn badly, I wonâ€™t worry about it. I sometimes tell myself that things that help others should be forgotten, others donâ€™t forget what they are doing, so you are grateful and feel that others are sorry for you.There are fewer places, and my heart is better. You are a person with great love. I feel that in this world, there should be a basic love between people. This kind of love is laid down under family and friendship. It is the most basic warmth of a society. It is a natural mutual help, mutual giving, and The most natural thing in human nature. He said: &quot;This way you don&#39;t have to worry about where to go. If you see someone, you don&#39;t have to be afraid, just like in your own home.&quot; I hope that society is a big family. He said: &quot;Your grandfather is me, I am your grandfather, the trick is a person.&quot; The couple is a person! How simple and how beautiful the concept of love and marriage is. The days of husband and wife have become a person, and the days of not being annoyed are plain and true. This is something that many couples can&#39;t do now. I teach people to be human. To behave with dignity, she said: &quot;Look at people with heart, talk to people with heart, don&#39;t feel that they are taller than others, don&#39;t be afraid that they are shorter than others.&quot; She also said: &quot;The human hand can&#39;t stretch easily, only one piece. Things can be stretched out, life-saving things!&quot; She also has her own set of educational methods. The book records how she teaches Ni Ping&#39;s brothers and sisters how to cherish food. It is very educational and profound, and they will be remembered forever. There is also a support for Ni Pingâ€™s not paying for the living expenses of the prostitute who is studying abroad, so that she can self-sufficiency. Ni Ping said that she is her teacher, I think this is true. She is good at family affairs. She often teaches Ni Ping to handle the relationship with her daughter-in-law. She also handles the relationship with the babysitter very well. She is not polite to the nanny, and sees the wrong place. I have been working all my life, I have a good cooking skill, and I have cooked at the age of 97. He lived very contently and said in her words: &quot;There is no big happiness in my life, a happy day.&quot; He said: &quot;A person with a bad heart doesn&#39;t know what is sweet or what is fragrant for a lifetime. I don&#39;t know what is full for a lifetime. Foot, just like eating a handful of salt to drink water, the stomach is full of qi, how much can people feel good? You look at the person who wants to hurt others, his face is hanging upside down, he is not happy. In the end, others hurt themselves, helping others finally help themselves, and don&#39;t believe you to try. The bad guys are fools, and they live unhappy for a lifetime!&quot; Ni Ping is ambiguous about this passage, saying that maybe he is right, maybe å§¥å§¥Anything wrong, no matter what, everyone hopes that this is the right thing, so that good people will be safe. Itâ€™s a habit to think about others beforehand. Therefore, Ni Ping said in the book that I donâ€™t know how to be seen at the water gate because of the good relationship. II donâ€™t want to be a good person. Having said that, I feel that you are a blessed person and an ordinary wife, but not ordinary. She has many profound life philosophies, and this is the blessing she brought to this family. But she knows that although she is content, she has lived peacefully for a lifetime, and she is only under the mountain. If she lives on the top of the mountain, she can live under the mountain for several generations, so she also encourages her children and grandchildren to go to the top of the mountain. Perhaps this It is the living method of the old man for the rest of his life.",movie
782,"Recently, the Hollywood film collective group bombed the big screen, whether it is &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; or &quot;Golden Shell&quot; or &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot; are coming to the forefront, in the middle there is the old hairy &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, and the previous release of &quot;Backwaters&quot; &quot;Shocking There is also Yu Wei in the Magic Pirates. This situation makes the location of Chinese films very embarrassing. It can be called a name. The attention is even rare. It can be said that the beginning of November, Chinese films are already in dire straits. However, if there is a big fire, there may be a phoenix that is reborn. Compared with the scene, the lineup, and the production, the domestic film is naturally not dominant. This is like the wrestling between the Chinese menâ€™s basketball team and the American Dream Team. It canâ€™t be bumped and can only play its own characteristics of small, smart and spiritual, that is, Sell â€‹â€‹stories and sell feelings. And the double 11 is coming, this &quot;single-single&quot; schedule has been a lot of Chinese films, and the leader is &quot;love lost 33 days.&quot; Today, the same emotional theme film &quot;I love you love me&quot; is showing up, the same abuse, the same poor mouth, and Bai Baidan with the same aura and fresh temperament, only Wang Xiaoyu was replaced by heavy taste. Uncle, but this uncle is hard enough, rich enough, and passionate, which undoubtedly strengthens the entire film to challenge Hollywood&#39;s arsenal. From the positioning of the film, in fact, it does not belong to the idol theme film, because the idol film must have handsome guys and sisters, and Wang Haodan and Zhang Hanyu are not really handsome guys, so the film will focus on the story. Telling the opportunity of Xiao Dan, played by Wang Xiaodan, smashed the boss Yapeng played by Zhang Hanyu. The former used his simplicity and optimism to awaken the love seed of the old man Yapeng. The two fell in love. I don&#39;t want to, after a while, Yapeng began to get tired of this life, and the two broke up peacefully. Later, Yapeng met two girls again, but in the end he found out that he loved the original little music, but the story was not as simple as this. When Xiaoleâ€™s ex-boyfriend appeared, it disturbed this simple and pure love. The story... The reason why in this big month &quot;I love you love me&quot; can be singled out &quot;Good Laihu&quot; because this film has the temperament of being a dark horse. First of all, this film is grounded. We must know that more and more girls now like the rich second generation, and the wealth of the second generation makes them feel insecure, so they turn to pursue the old man who has achieved a successful career. This is a social phenomenon. It is also something that some girls dare not dare to do. When this group read this film, there will be a strong sense of resonance and appeal, and they will find their own self in Wang Yidanâ€™s body, and they will be full in Zhang Hanyu.Full of your own sexual fantasies. And the film also joined a sissy man, I wonder if it is also in the shadow of the &quot;false mother&quot; phenomenon. Of course, one more important thing is the &quot;time of day.&quot; The American blockbuster does not understand China&#39;s national conditions. In the double 11 &quot;Single Day&quot;, it is still not appropriate to use the cannons of the aircraft to bomb the Chinese fans&#39; vision. This schedule is more suitable for an old bachelor, a pair of little lovers, a person who has had a story sitting in the theater, watching a small film of love, suitable. In addition, the whole story of the film, the relationship and clues between the characters will make you cry a few pieces of paper towels sitting in the theater. Today&#39;s love films can do this very difficult. Here, I also hope that the film &quot;I love you love me&quot; can set off the banner of domestic films in this battle.",movie
783,"In the praise of a fan, as a non-beauty powder non-hammer powder non-shake powder passers-by come to an objective (pseudo) comment. Marvel&#39;s movie is really more and more mature, &quot;Raytheon 2 &quot;It&#39;s like a work created on a factory assembly line. It&#39;s like taking a ruler and taking a measure.&quot; Where to have a smile, where to fight, where to play, where to sell rot, the various parts of the arrangement of the standard, will not go wrong, but also too predictable ... can see that &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; very accommodating fans, to loki The chemical reaction between thor and thor has increased more than a few times. The comics havenâ€™t been seen clearly, but I believe it should be very satisfying to the comic fans. In the satisfaction of the fans, the average audience has also been considered, the action is a lot of action, the rhythm is not delayed, the standard mentioned before is not wrong, love to watch the big film should not be disappointed. And even if I think the film is general, you make me pick a thorn, I can&#39;t pick anything. &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; is indeed a popcorn masterpiece, but it didn&#39;t make me particularly impressed. The sister who I watched together said that the Raytheon series is four words, simple and rude. I thought about what she said is quite right. I also know why I donâ€™t particularly like &quot;Raytheon 2&quot;. &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; is good enough to satisfy the look and feel and fan psychology. Therefore, it gave up as a The comic book heroes are adapted from popcorn, and more importantly, as something that a movie should have. I may say that there may be some force, but I think that the production of &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; can only be described as &quot;simple and rude&quot;, using the simplest and most unprepared way to promote the development of the story, streamlining the film to only explode The part of the rice flower, what kind of psychological portrayal, the transition of the plot, etc. can be thrown away and discarded. After reading and forgetting, I canâ€™t leave any impression. I am not asking for the depth and content of &quot;Raytheon 2&quot;. What is the demand for a commercial film? I just think that even as a commercial film, don&#39;t be purely killing or selling rot. I think that &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; is almost the same as &quot;Special Forces&quot;, although I don&#39;t like this year&#39;s &quot;Wolverine&quot;. 2&quot;, but I have at least seen &quot;Wolverine 2&quot; has been deliberately shaping the characters, to pave the background. The film of Marvel now is like a mold, full of craftsmanship. This year&#39;s Disney Marvel&#39;s two films, &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; and &quot;Raytheon 2&quot;, these two films are almost indistinguishable to me, can not see the director&#39;s personal style, it is likeOne person took it. I think this is probably the inevitable result of the mature production system of Marvel. In these movies, the director should have no great initiative. In fact, we can understand that after all, the film company is a businessman, making money first, and making comic movies so best to meet the needs of different groups of people. After all, you can&#39;t expect every director to shoot a movie like Batman like Nolan. This way of making it is the best choice in business and the least risk. Just as a fan, I still hope that the future North American film market can see different, more sincere works, rather than being flooded by such &quot;movie line products.&quot;",movie

785,"If the &quot;Chocolate&quot; film is counted, there are still a few that can be counted. What impresses you most is Juliet Binoche and Johnny Depp&#39;s Chocolate, and Mexico&#39;s Chocolate. Lover, etc., a small chocolate, full of invincible divine power, light into the mouth, delicate aftertaste, smooth taste, endless infinite, that wonderful moment, also inspired the inspiration of countless art creators, For example, the above &quot;chocolate&quot; is a movie, such as &quot;Sweet Chocolate.&quot; &quot;Sweetheart Chocolate&quot; is not a domestically produced film in the strict sense. In addition to the heroine Lin Zhiling is a Chinese star from the other side of the strait, the two handsome men in the safari pool and Bosuke Yusuke Yusuke are all AIA brothers, director Sugawara Tetsuo. It is also a friend of the country, so don&#39;t be blinded by the big Lin Zhiling&#39;s head on the poster. This is not a clichÃ© of domestic love movies, but a Japanese pure love movie full of small fresh flavors, from characters to stories. There is a feeling of &quot;Love Letter&quot; in the past, of course, as far as the plot is concerned, it seems to be closer to &quot;Blue Love and Death&quot;. The story of &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; is not complicated. It tells the story of Lin Chi-ling&#39;s role as a Shanghai girl. She went to Japan to study and paint in Hokkaido. At the ski resort in Yubari, I met two ambulancemen in the snow field, respectively. A Shou, and as the captain of the General A, the snow field is lonely, the snow field guards the man is even more lonely, suddenly met such a beautiful Chinese woman, how can you not be tempted? The two have a feeling of love at first sight, but the older A-General, basically appears as a big brother, because he knows that the young A-shou also likes this girl, so, SO, the farthest distance in the world, not every party But I am by your side, but help my brother to soak you, I believe, when the general teammates riding a motorcycle to open the heart-shaped pattern on the snow, add a love for A Shou and Lin sister When I saw a fire, when I saw them in the snow, my heart was extremely painful. The world is always so tormented, A Shou, a man who loves to make chocolate, has a thick chocolate-like love, Ah, a man who can&#39;t make chocolate, but always tastes the bitterness of chocolate. Of course, Linâ€™s sister should be able to detect all of this. If the story takes place in China, the next decision will be simple. It depends on who has a car or a room, or a bigger car and a bigger room, but in our AIA, love is still in the most simple and simple stage, Lin sister is still easy to chooseI will make chocolate, and I will send flowers and romance in the library. I will put a huge red heart in the snow for courtship, and even young and handsome A Shou classmates. Of course, the later stories don&#39;t need to be guessed. The so-called &quot;show love, die fast&quot;, in time in the most beautiful Hokkaido of AIA, this rule also applies, Ah Shou you are too swaying, so you must OVER in the accident ! The specific plot, everyone has to enter the theater to know. However, our sister Lin loved him so deeply that he took over the clothes of his life, and opened the &quot;sweet chocolate&quot; shop as he wished. Well, I cut into the theme. In fact, at the beginning of the film, it was the scene of the chocolate shop. But as the owner of the store, Linâ€™s sister can always remember the unforgettable past of herself and the two Japanese men. She is also constantly Looking for a taste of chocolate, this taste is the exclusive recipe of A Shou, but did not have time to tell her. Busy about her boyfriend&#39;s nostalgia, as well as the research of chocolate, Lin sister, too much to ignore the always-awaited A-General, but A total is also a shy person, every day in the pocket of a diamond ring to ask for help to go to the bar to get drunk. Such a scene, we are common in Japanese and Korean film and television dramas, the audience in front of the big screen in front of the TV, all shouted out, the protagonists inside, turned into a dumb gun, perhaps they could not understand their implicit Love is too tempered, and finally there is a derogatory Chinese uncle? The handsome boss of the bar, stopped this endless torture, and snarled at Linâ€™s sister, to the effect that love must be done â€œ A red heart, prepared with both hands, since one is gone, why bother? Time waits for no one, hurry and grab another. Sure enough, the plot turned sharply. After a minute, Linâ€™s sister and Ahâ€™s were better. Although the wait for ten years of kisses, Linâ€™s sister fainted like a suffocation, but it could not hinder it. It was a frozen up to ten. Year&#39;s icebreaking trip. Oh, I forgot a detail, I donâ€™t know how to make chocolate. After a few clumsy studies, I actually made the mysterious taste of Ah Shou. In fact, we know that what Lin sister has been looking for is the taste of love. This story is very suitable for couples to watch, the story is ups and downs, sorrows and joys, but the ending is full of positive energy of love. After the movie is over, if you are a boy, buy a chocolate to accompany her, or this Marriage is sought, to believe in the artistic appeal of film and television works, but also to believe in the magic of chocolate.

786,"About Time &quot;Time Lovers&quot; should have been too late to enter the cinema, but I ran at the last moment and saw that there was no levy. I really looked good, and the posters of the moving and warm (Y) movies were beautiful. The heroine on the poster looks like that very happy smile, and at the same time people feel that this is a love movie. But the movie is not just a love movie, but also a family relationship. The complete interpretation is the mastery of time and the cherishment of the people around you. The first half of the story is a love story. When Tim was 21 years old, his father was frank with him after the New Year&#39;s Eve: the men of our family were born with the power of time and space. Although Tim can&#39;t change history, he can change some small things that happened in his life and will happen, so he decided to use his ability to make life better.? To put it bluntly, he hopes to find a girlfriend for himself. . However, this is not as easy as he believes. Tim moved from the Cornish coast to London and was trained as a lawyer. Here he finally met a beautiful but less confident girl named Mary. The two fell in love. However, in a &quot;crossing&quot;, Tim&#39;s careless change is like a &quot;butterfly effect&quot; that makes him have no chance to meet Mary in his future life. Through time and again, Tim met Mary again and again, and he finally won her heart. The story of this love story is really touching and feeling warm. The male protagonist constantly travels through time and space to make up for his own small mistakes. It makes up a misfortune and brews another misunderstanding. It is quite funny. Both boys and girls have the same qualities. It seems that they are relatively lonely, out of the world, and they are not very confident. Only in a party where they can&#39;t see each other can they ignite love. The young couple are very warm together and live a happy and energetic day in the beautiful and romantic city of London. The film took pictures of the two people who had to take the subway to work every day. Every day is different, but the same is true of love. It is really a waste of not falling in such a beautiful city. Most remember the wedding. During the wedding, there was heavy rain under the wind, and the shed was collapsed. Everyone was soaked, but everyone was very happy! I was thinking, if this happened in the real world, wouldn&#39;t everyone be furious and full of faces? I know that Chinese people are like that. I don&#39;t know what Westerners think. This storm will add to the wedding and will be an unforgettable memory. Just as the actor asked him if the bride regretted the wedding, it was raining this day.The bride said happily, but she was very happy. There is nothing perfect in the world, and all the imperfections and even the terrible things will one day turn into good memories, and the mouth will rise. I thought the story would be a happy ending and a deadline. It turned out not. Another main story of the story is on the family story, which is also Tim&#39;s family. Tim&#39;s entire family is shaped very well, and almost every family member is a weirdo, adding a lot of fun. But the atmosphere of the whole family is very heart-felt, stupid things everyone do together, gave birth to Tim, a good boy who is kind and stupid. Tim traveled through time and space to help his injured sister, and also went back to find the lost father. But the time is not short, and one day everything needs to end, and Tim will finally give up. At this time, Dad decided to bring Tim back to the happy time he used to play at the beach together. This scene is very touching. This may be the scene he has forgotten that he has forgotten, reappears again, and relives it again. Timâ€™s relationship with his family is so enviable, I wonder if itâ€™s the same for Western families. I believe that more people like me, in love friendship and affection, we always show the most alienation of family. We seem to have been pursuing love, and we always like to get together with friends, and we only share our feelings with our friends. The relationship with our family is more and more subtle with age. This is really unfair, because family is the greatest. I know this, but I still can&#39;t change the fact that [family is always so subtle]... Like the actor, I also have a sister. His interaction with my sister makes me see a little shadow. However, the relationship with Dad is more implicit to the freezing point, and the mind is always very difficult to express. The film is a reflexive movie, and I slap a few slaps on my face. How realistic and sincere the film is, and what has happened to everyone. About Time. Time is wonderful for us, sometimes we feel too cruel, it always slips away when we are happy. We live in time from birth to death, every minute and every second is time. The story allows us to see some facts through the ability of a big boy to take control of time. It is true that the hero has this ability to hate sharply, but at the same time, he also knows more about the facts that are indisputable. The most perfect life is that imperfections still want to continue. Life is perfect and imperfect, it is to look at your attitude. Every day is happy, every day is perfect. CherishThe mentality, and the loved ones around you, all the loved ones are happy, and it is not important to have this ability to travel through time and space. Movies sometimes don&#39;t need any gorgeous scripts, high technology. Sincere sincerity, simple stories, and mirror-like resonance, you can also create a good movie. Besides, the play is really funny, and the yellow jokes that are inserted from time to time are all laughing. Then I recommend the original soundtrack of the movie, a lot of great songs, and French songs, which add a lot to the movie. Now I listen to it every day. The cinema is down, I hope everyone will download it later, a super-sound British movie (Y)",movie

The collection of Lin Zhiling, Chiuchibo, and Fudi Yusuke are the three Asian red stars, which together complete the warmth of this coolness. The warmth of the work, can be called the most solid and most beautiful love film in the near future. The film is closely related to the emotional entanglement of three young men and women for nearly ten years, creating a pure love triangle relationship that is patient and interesting.

There are many different kinds of love in the world. No one is exactly the same. No one can copy. Only the feeling of sweetness and bitterness is common. The director is trying to explore the essence of love through these two classic emotions, and to pass on the energy and hope of love to the audience. The tranquility of Hokkaido and the monks of Shanghai, these elements are written in a layered array of innocent love lyrics. Every picture of &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; is exquisite, not only has a visual beauty, but also has a long taste, which can be used for the audience to savor, slowly relish, the wind in Hokkaido, the quiet woods, white The snow-capped mountains give people a strong audio-visual impact, and the characters in the snow can form outstanding personality and extraordinary charm among the magnificent world. It is worth mentioning that as the core figure in the film? Lin Yue&#39;s play, Lin Chi-ling&#39;s cooperation with Japanese counterparts is very tacit, not only the characters are truly credible, but also the opponents of Chisui Bozhi and Fudi Yusuke are also very capable. The power of the lines, the understanding of the story and the characters, has made no small progress compared to the &quot;101 marriage proposal.&quot; In the past two years, Lin Chi-ling has achieved good results in the field of romance films. The characters played are urban fashion women. &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; continues this goddess line, but it has a breakthrough in style. Confused, no longer chasing trends andThe power of packaging, but to challenge the classics, in a period of interlaced time and space, staged a beautiful pure love drama about terminal illness. Today, Lin Chi-ling has become the most appealing big screen goddess in Chinese-language film. From the original vase of &quot;Red Cliff&quot; and &quot;Ting Ling&quot;, &quot;Decisive Battle of the Horse Town&quot; boldly ugly, &quot;Happiness Amount&quot;, &quot;101 marriage proposal&quot; &quot;Tianji? Fuchunshan Residence&quot; has become a box office weapon, and then to this &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; inside and outside the pure love drama, Lin Chi-ling&#39;s transformation and progress is impressive, although some people will say that this is due to her talent? God-given beauty, but it is undeniable that the ability to play talent requires a strong ability.",movie
789,"In order to watch &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot;, I have experienced some twists and turns. First, I made an appointment with my sister&#39;s sister to make a temporary appointment. Then, before the departure, the company leader called and asked me to deal with urgent matters, and I was going to be late. I am bothered and dry, almost giving up the booking. But after all, I still deeply loved Zhilingâ€™s sister. She resolutely took all the hardships and went alone. She sat in the shadow room with a pair of surprised eyes. When the field lights were dark, the voice of Zhilingâ€™s sister rang in the ear, and I finally left my anxiety and jealousy behind me. After watching the movie, my first thought turned out to be, but fortunately I was put a pigeon. Because I once introduced to the girl, this is a &quot;funny piece of love.&quot; In fact, in this love story of literary atmosphere, some are bitter and sweet intertwined, some are the pain of love and love, although there are several relaxed and humorous, but can not rise to the level of hilarity. The reason why I made this mistake was because I misled myself. One impression came from Hollywood&#39;s &quot;Love Chocolate&quot;. It was also chocolate that gave birth to love. There was a lot of sharp humor and ridicule in the film. More importantly, many posters of &quot;Sweetheart&quot; are two men and one woman. Zhiling&#39;s sister is a woman in the middle of a big sister. Two neon handsome guys are laughing and laughing. How do they look like &quot;single men and women&quot; and so on? The reappearance of chasing a woman and gradually escalating the law, not to mention the fact that Zhilingâ€™s sister has already performed a 101-day proposal of the same type. I know, &quot;Sweetheart&quot; can not play anything to pick up the girl Dafa, the sister god skills, the strange enemy contest is even more disappeared. The pursuit of the goddess is nothing more than teaching skiing, sitting on the Ferris wheel, sending flowers to send chocolate, and putting a big red heart in the snow. Nowadays, college students know how to play more dazzling. The film reminds me of Xu Anhua&#39;s &quot;Tian Shui Wai&quot; and &quot;Peach Sister&quot;. This is a theme that the Eight Diagrams can&#39;t beat, but it evokes a similar experience. In the movie of Xu&#39;s movie, the life of the lovers is contrasted with the lover&#39;s entanglement in the &quot;Sweetheart&quot;. Love is nothing more than simply chasing and watching. How many twists and turns are bizarre, how come the winds and waves, a memory is unforgettable, Itâ€™s been enough for ten years. The ups and downs of the ups and downs are basically absent here, even if the role of Fudi Yusuke is accidentally killed (this is not a spoiler, the full content of the network has written this point), considering the high risk of his ski ambulance career, and Not in the Korean drama section of the dog blood. I have been imagining when watching the film, is it possible that this story will happen around me? The conclusion is that in addition to the feeling of having a castle in the air, it is also closely attached.The rhythm of life. Do not say anything else, I donâ€™t dare to show love in the pool, but Iâ€™m just like a friendâ€™s experience. Recently met him on the Internet, always inevitably talked about his emotional frustration, I am very concerned about urging him to boldly pursue the girl, change the way to make some tricks, he always hesitates, look forward to the future, do not dare to fire. After watching the film, I sent him a text message, suggesting that he ask the girl to look at &quot;Sweetheart&quot; and hope that the monks on the screen can promote a marriage under the screen. The name of the soundtrack can be used as a popular selling point for the film. It is also rare in Europe and the United States. In Asia, only the Kojima is the only one. The main theme of the film is quite pleasant. Every time there are three emotions of &quot;touching the scene&quot;, &quot;true feelings confession&quot; and &quot;remembering sadness&quot;, they will sound in time, and the arrangement is very brainy. I have been jealous on the way home. Several scores are very much like the prelude of Japanese rhythm and blues songs. Listening and listening, I am always afraid that a female voice will suddenly sing, which makes me a bit of a play, probably the Japanese song I listen to is too single. In general, this soundtrack is not the highest level of Hisaishi, but it is enough to be used as a background in a book bar or coffee shop. The more condolence is that if you pay attention to the dragon mark before the opening, the year marked in brackets is actually 2012. The original film was taken for the 40th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. The Japanese idol starring fluent Japanese, two Japanese handsome guys playing the drama, the story is placed in Shanghai and Hokkaido, telling the love between a clothes and a water, as a tribute is really appropriate, one year More recently, it was unveiled at the Tokyo International Film Festival. However, due to the tension between China and Japan last year, the release of the mainland was postponed to this year, and the propaganda was not as expected. Fortunately, for the fans, the chocolate itself is still purely delicious, and has not lost its temptation because of the political impurities. It also allows me to see my younger one-year-old Zhiling sister. Zhiling sister continues to show the beauty of the face that makes the girls hate, slightly apply powder, not soft light, delicate and delicate face, blow the skin to break the hair, sit firmly in the first place, donâ€™t say College students, there are no flaws in playing high school students. In the second half, she had several tearful scenes, and the camera didn&#39;t move until the two lines of tears fell. It was clearly a confident expression: I didn&#39;t have heavy makeup, otherwise the makeup would have been spent. In other movies, I would say that the chocolate shop business is booming is an art exaggeration, but the film is 100% realistic, if my city has such a chocolate Shih Tzu, even if the team at the door is the most expensive nightclubStill long, I am not patronizing.",movie
790,"Psychedelic is a movie that is hard to find a suitable language to describe. Danny Bower tested the audience&#39;s psychology and IQ with dazzling lens angles and contrasting colors. The Witch in the Air is the beginning and the end of everything. In this painting, three witches with horned caps float in the air. The men in their arms seemed to be struggling with horror and seemed to be falling. At the bottom of the screen, there is a man with his hands covered with white cloth. The thumb of his hands is tied to the other four fingers. This gesture is called figo, which means avoiding the devil and evil. At the bottom left is a man who looks very painful and squats on the floor. In the lower right corner of the picture, there is a scorpion that is almost swallowed by the dark background. So what exactly attracted Danny Bower in this seemingly painful and creepy oil painting? Francisco de Goya is a Spanish Romanticist painter. In the film, he is called &quot;the first painter to depict human thinking.&quot; Goya&#39;s style of painting is bizarre and varied. From the early Baroque style to the later expressionist works, his life is always changing. Goyaâ€™s father was a gold-plated smith, and his mother was born and died. He was poor and had no formal education. His life in his later years was very bleak. After he resigned as the chief painter of the court for many years, his wife died. Goya was seriously ill and his ears completely lost his hearing. In the rest of his life, Goya has lived a life of deep and simple, isolated, and hides in his own &quot;house&quot;. In the fifth year after deafness, Goya created this &quot;Witch in the Air&quot;. Another important element in the movie is hypnosis. Hypnosis has always been one of the most mysterious and fascinating elements of the film. In Psychedelic, it is given more power and meaning. In addition to treating various mental illnesses, hypnotist Eliza can also make the protagonist Simon forget the fact that he loves her distortedly. It is precisely because of this that the fate of the three protagonists in the film has changed. Danny Bower uses a lot of cool and warm colors, intended to build a world of memory from the front and back, as well as debris. Frank&#39;s home is based on black and brown, while Eliza&#39;s home is used to represent the enthusiasm and ambition of orange. In addition, the film uses a lot of white, blue, brown, green, etc. or cold or warm colors. Danny Bower also uses a large number of complex, complex mirrors, glass and other mirrors for the watch.Simon is now breaking the broken memory. James McKay is one of the outstanding young actors in this movie. He is one of the outstanding young actors who have emerged in recent years. His style of performance that can suddenly erupt in calm reminds me of Jack Nicholson in his youth and Nicholas Cage in his time. But in this psychedelic, sometimes the rhythm of his emotional transition seems too fast, and sometimes the emotions are so strong that it will make people play. Rosario Dawsonâ€™s performance is the most amazing. The youngest character she had made before she became famous was the collaboration with Quentin Tarantino and Rodriguez. However, in this psychedelic she can also play a feminine beauty that is either gentle or dangerous. Contributor: Wuliang Instructor WeChat: oldlostboy418 QQ: 59979593",movie
791,"Continued to write the story of 9 years ago, the agreement of Vienna failed to fulfill, but it was 9 years later to meet again on the streets of Paris. The two people after the change of time have not changed in time. 9 years ago after the dawn dawn, 9 years later, separation and sunset before dusk, the story in the book is too ideal, we donâ€™t know, but in fact, always meet inadvertently, Paris is a good place, it must be better than you think. Better, but there must be a story worth remembering, in the alleys of Paris, not in the shops of the Champs ElysÃ©es. For the two people who have reunited for a long time, Paris may have lost a little bit of the confusion brought by Vienna&#39;s strangeness. At least the heroine&#39;s life is already familiar with the city&#39;s bit by bit. There is no need to render any more romantic, more realistic encounters. But it&#39;s a shuttle, talking about each other&#39;s stories. Seemingly simple dialogue, casual words seem to be not so unforgettable, but it is fascinating, always feel that such a story is so appropriate under the European mottled old bricks, it will be too much to change a feast a feeling of. The reason why this series of movies became classic is that it left too much aftertaste. The spectators in the story are infected by the scenery of Europe and the emotions of the heroes and heroines. Everything seems to be so simple and simple, stop and go. Unintentional, enviable, the original love can have nothing, just drink a cup of coffee at the corner of the coffee shop, and learn to take a few minutes of cruises on the Seine. Everyone can easily become a tourist on the Seine. But not everyone can meet a French girl who met in Vienna nine years ago. The feeling of like this movie is very clean. As for the others, it is hard to say anything. The dialogues that you come to me are not lacking in the philanthropy of the literary youth. In my opinion, there is no need to copy them into The maxim, rather than the brains of remembering, is better to experience a rare romance, in fact, think about it is not much romance, just like the girl finally complained about her bad life, saying that she does not want to believe in love, just like a man has already Marriage and children are no longer the unscrupulous teenagers. The reality is that the unsuccessful Viennaâ€™s agreement and the object are two people. The ideal is that it may change the lives of the two people into an eternal ideal, so the girl may or may not What to change, maybe the two will not be happy, it is better like this, when I meet again, I feel late. The most romantic love is to love only a littleLove, as the poem says, &quot;Other people come and see, I only peek at you.&quot;",movie
792,"I downloaded it very early on the computer, and I didnâ€™t dare to move because of the five-hour length. The five-hour split for two days is considered to be the result of the blood in the film. I believe that every complete movie viewer will have a lot of different feelings about this film. This is the ambition of Wei Desheng I understand. Civilization and barbarism, bullying and resistance, and the end of the conflict, we use the killing to complete the return. Emotionally inevitably with the Seidkes, the results that have long been foreseen, and the process of realization of tragic growth, but also heartache. A paper horse is closed, and the land is handed over. If the country is really private, then there will be a willing people. In Taiwan, which has been abandoned more than once in history, does the national blessing really bring people a sense of security? The growth of the Datong area really hinders the understanding of the feelings and experiences of people in special areas. From this perspective, I like Putin&#39;s toughness: although Russia is large, not one inch of land is redundant.",movie

The teenagers in this play are no longer referring to individuals alone. He is the past of acquaintances, the old man, the rock and roll teenager who used to be excited. He may be a vulnerable group, or it may be a person who has gradually become a vested interest after struggling. Whether it is a teenager, a host, or a deputy director, they are all grassmen who are laughing in a hundred steps. Grass people can be sacrificed in the face of a more powerful class.

794,"For the first time in the Avengers, I knew Raytheon. In the story of the superhero gathering, the only god of thunder became a muscular man who would only make brute force. Look at &quot;Raytheon 1&quot;, he is completely a strong and savage, only know the superman flying with a hammer, only the perfect figure of the ancient Greek statue is worth relishing, empty Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman&#39;s gold lineup. Fortunately, with &quot;Raytheon 2&quot;, in front of it, &quot;Raytheon 1&quot; suddenly became a single-celled paramecium, it exists only to tell us that Natalie Portman is a scientist friend of Raytheon, and Raytheon has a A grotesque but deaf-stricken younger brother. And the story is simple enough to &quot;the gods and the humans fall in love with each other, in order to shoot the next one, they have no happy life together, in love, he successfully defeated the first phase of the evil brother who tried to destroy his throne to win the throne.&quot; Than, the story of &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; is full of three-dimensional. In two years, Raytheonâ€™s girlfriend has become a well-established scientist in search of Thorâ€™s trace. She traced the connection between a mysterious substance in the universe and the movement of the celestial body, so the dark matter, cosmic galaxy, time appearing in the story. The setting of empty space, time and space shuttle smoothly laid the foundation for science students to save the whole universe. Compared with the seemingly under-invested &quot;Raytheon 1&quot;, &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; is magnificent, and the dark interstellar is full of desolation. Even in the first part, the gods look a little stupid and dressed in the second part. The epic feeling, many times there is a golden Saint Seiya look, not so awkward. Compared with the previous one, Natalie Portman became the most influential part of this movie named Raytheon as the girlfriend of Raytheon. If you want to find a very smart and classical in Hollywood, you have done a scientist, you have a relationship with the gods, and you are brave. The actress who has played the monster must be her. When she was in the palace of the gods, it was gorgeous and classical. There was a kind of DIOR advertisement, which was the sense of sight. When she successfully accepted the big BOSS with the instrument she invented, there was no sense of disobedience. In this movie of aliens attacking the gods, I think of our dear Amindala, I can&#39;t help but sigh as a brain powder. I really watched her movie grow up. Raytheonâ€™s younger brother, Loki, once again brushed a sense of existence in this department. Although the tricks of those brothers have already been guessed, it does not affect him to be blackened and whitewashed.Blackening again, then washing white, and finally achieving an attraction that is full of evil and heart-rending. And Portman&#39;s intern, Daisy, is exactly MAX&#39;s coming from &quot;Bankrupt Girl&quot;, which makes this movie, which has long been insignificant, full of humor. Itâ€™s just pity that Raytheon himself, although he is struggling to fly and behave in the movie, but this tall and full image is often degraded into a wall. Although he has already understood strategy and cooperation in this section in the first part, my favorite place is actually the moment when he puts the hammer on the hanger when he enters the house. It is a godsend. Although Raytheon 2 is just a story of a science student saving the universe, it is still full of creativity. In addition to the background of time space and cosmic celestial bodies that are almost understood by the physical knowledge of the entire high school, there are some small details that are clever and can&#39;t help. And the images of the gorgeous and profound universe and the dazzling time-space tunnels are still beautiful even in the domestic dark 3D screens without the bottom line. Although the legendary end of the double egg did not see, but the end of the film is still very worth a look. On the weekend of the early winter, taking such a dose of &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; suddenly began to burn again.",movie

799,"Park Shu sings, &quot;Honey is very sweet, coffee is bitter, but I never refuse all taste.&quot; The protagonist, the uncle, the successful person, and the passionate old man Zhang Hanyu are such a person who does not refuse all kinds of deliciousness in love. . Whether it is a little naughty that is naughty and hurt, a mature and sturdy career sister, or a sweet and gentle kindergarten teacher, he has tried it one by one and loved it seriously, but in the end he found that he couldnâ€™t let it go, or that she, once made The most powerful thing is that he can&#39;t stand it, and she can&#39;t wait to let her roll up and lay her hands. This kind of love story that is not acquainted with is an important mode of love movies. A pair of men and women who are on the tip of a pair of eyes and ears, from each other, do not look good, to the death of love, can no longer be separated, almost everyoneâ€™s mind The definition of love twists and turns, the film is no exception. But the difference is that the film turns the process of discovering and approaching a pair of men and women into a process of men&#39;s inspection and selection of different women in their lives. At first glance, it seems quite a bit of a man&#39;s daydreaming narcissism. Zhang Hanyu plays the leading role, handsome, multi-gold, gentleman, in the &quot;play not to move&quot;, want to find a good woman to smash the prime time, is the best choice for many women. He turned his left and right to the three love objects, and he was indecisive. In a sense, he became a contest between the three women for his own tricks. (Although the editorial subjectively did not mean this, but if the netizens associate this, they can understanding). The ultimate winner must be the most intelligent one, but it may be the one who loves him the most. The film circumvents the comedy, lyrics and even the dog&#39;s blood that may appear in this story. It adopts the most orthodox approach. Although the first half is full of some light comedy atmosphere, it is basically a love drama. The three women in the film, each with different types, ages across the &quot;three generations of young and middle-aged&quot;, clearly symbolizing the different desires and aspirations of men for women. Zhu Dan played the royal sister is a mother-type, in the film she took care of Zhang Han to leave the soup, and put a hangover in his pocket, plus a kind of &quot;cheesy&quot; smile, live is to arrange the mother The product of the complex; Li Chengyuan&#39;s female teacher is a lover type. The first scene she came up with was to present herself as a birthday present to a man. After the event, she did not forget that the bird was lying on the man. In a sentence, you have to exercise in the future, I will supervise you. She is a type of man who is afraid of and eager, and is a direct embodiment of the libido and the escape of sexual desire. The girl played by Wang Haodan is basically a daughter-typeA variety of naughty, naughty, and caring, is the embodiment of the illusion of a woman entangled by a woman with a love complex. This setting, although it is simple, can basically make the audience understand and quickly enter. For the secondary female characters, this slightly labelled setting is obviously necessary for the sake of clarity. In addition, I have to say that the performances of Zhu Dan and Li Chengyuan are somewhat more natural and natural than the protagonist Wang Dandan. It seems that they are like this. In the latter part of the film, Zhang Hanyu was basically entangled in the process between the three women. With the younger teacher, he couldnâ€™t put in Loli, and he was ready to take care of Loli. The kindergarten teacher had a new situation and returned to the kindergarten. Around him, Lori also offered a new big killer, which made him have to look back again. This anti-repetition and undulating setting has the need for narrative rhythm, but it illustrates the dilemma of men&#39;s choice of women. This will make the feminist sneer, thinking that it is just another daydreaming movie of a man, and the director seems to be consciously avoiding this, so the narrative of Loliâ€™s perspective appears and how she looks for herself. The mention of the growth process of love can be seen as a kind of packaging for the director&#39;s true intentions. Perhaps this kind of packaging will allow more female viewers to enter the theater. (Finish)",movie
800,"The camera began with a young and fashionable heroine, dressed in a Chanel, and she was waiting for the plane. She waited for the star mother of the show, and the two beautiful women met each other. &quot;High Heels&quot; tells the story of a mother and daughter who have been lingering for a lifetime. The mother&#39;s second half of life and her daughter&#39;s first half of life, a story. The story seems to be nothing new: the mother who made the star always ignored her daughter Rebecca and was finally &quot;punished&quot; for her atonement. The plot was very clever: Rebecca and her mother&#39;s former lover were married, and the arrival of her mother made her see that her husband had not loved her, so Rebecca killed her husband. Coincidentally, the judge who handled the case liked Rebecca and was bent on helping her to wash her crimes. The judge arranged for Rebecca to go to prison with her mother. Rebecca put her grievances on her mother from childhood and told her mother that she had killed the mother she loved when she was a child? Her stepfather. The mother was strongly stimulated, had a heart attack, and left fingerprints on Rebeccaâ€™s gun at the end of her life, sinning for her. There are many subtle coincidences, such as the judge&#39;s multiple identities, one of which is a transvestite performance at the bar, which he imitates is the star mother of Rebecca&#39;s heart. It was not until later that the daughter discovered that the judge and the actor were the same person, and she had already fallen in love with him and still had his child. Her relationship with the judge was in the backstage of the bar, when the judge had not yet unloaded the female costume. This film is more convergent than the later films of Almodovar. The theme of homosexuality and incest has always been Almodovar&#39;s best management. The judge seems to have been sent to pardon Rebecca, protecting her from legal sanctions and giving her a complete family she has never had before. He understood Rebecca&#39;s love for his mother to transcend everything. Rebecca&#39;s fascination is in her dare to love and hate, and her sorrow is all from the woman&#39;s nature, she is a mixture of sexy women and children, regardless of appearance or heart. The abrupt role of the judge may have been born out of the actor who kidnapped the beloved in order to have a home in &quot;Bundled Me, Tied to Me&quot;. Male characters in Almodovar are more likely than women to build a family. They are shaped like this to express a desire for &quot;reality&quot;? If you don&#39;t call it love. There is also Benino, the actor who fell in love with the vegetative people in &quot;To her,&quot; and he summoned a miracle in his own way. These men want to &quot;tame&quot; women, sometimes do it themselves, sometimes fake God. Their wishes are so strong, because women have long been &quot;incorrigible.&quot; Like the mother in High HeelsLike the pro, these urban girls have long been lost, they are glamorous, and they only want to perform in front of everyone. Vanity becomes the biggest obstacle between the mother and the daughter in the story (or between all women?). When she was a child, Rebecca killed the stepfather who hindered her mother&#39;s career in order to &quot;achieve&quot; her mother&#39;s career. The mother promised to take her to film, but the mother reneged. What Rebecca can&#39;t bear most is betrayal. So she later killed her husband who rekindled her mother with fire. She did not hate her mother. He hated the husband&#39;s heart. Rebecca is a natural actor and sees her calm after she was killed. She is more &quot;into the play&quot; than her mother, and life is a stage play in her eyes. The judge was also confused by her?? It was said that the person was killed by her. After a while, the unsuspecting victim looked like a love for her husband. Both of them are her, she splits very badly. Half of her longing for love in life, half of her thought of her mother&#39;s illusory life. The two are usually not compatible. She is under the pull of these two forces. The appearance of the judge (love) is not enough for her to give up her mother&#39;s image. Only the mother&#39;s last sacrifice makes her suddenly wake up and eventually abandon the absolute. Yearning for the illusory star life. Rather than saying that she has been imitating her mother, it is better to say that she and her mother are on the wrong road, and that the mother understands this before her death, and Rebeccaâ€™s collapse is even earlier. She unexpectedly killed herself on TV, and this was her most sublime performance. As a female anchor of the news, she usually does not have the opportunity to show her heart, but only to be consumed by a beautiful appearance. This time she portrayed herself as an infatuated woman who is crazy about love, killing him because she loves her husband too much. She is sincere, but she only said half of the truth. She loves her husband, but she loves her mother more. It can be said that she and her mother are rivals. She can also say that she has helped her mother to remove the man who deceived her. She has done a very feminine thing from a purely female perspective. She does not marry her mother, she sympathizes. She used her actions to condemn her motherâ€™s incest and incest. In prison, the daughter heard the mother&#39;s concert from the tape recorder. It is the one that the judge sang when he was ready to play. Think about me. This time, the mother sang the score and was really sincere. She told the audience that the song was dedicated to the daughter in prison. The unfortunate encounter of the star mother touched the fans. She kissed the stage and she shed tears. However, no matter how real the emotions, she still performed on the stage. Thus Rebecca and the mother have completed their mostThe moving curtain call ended their performance career. After the bustling, they can join hands to play a no-attack but touching audience, that is, the climax of the end of the film, the mother&#39;s dying. &quot;When you are in pain, think about me.&quot; The mother sang to her daughter, but their feelings were too deep, and Rebecca heard her songs only more painful. In contrast, judges who are easy to install are much easier. The judge sang this song to her as she was dressed as a mother. The meaning is different: when you are suffering, instead of thinking about the mother on TV, think about me in reality. The judge also has a mother who stays at home for many years. Her favorite is to cut newspapers and dream, and live in illusion. The â€œmothersâ€ have escaped the real life, and the judges and daughters are not willing to be manipulated by the media. Like many characters in the Almodovar film, they perform in life, covering up their unknown identities and relationships: judges and murderers, transvestites and homosexuals, they are not allowed for the mainstream, and love is theirs. The way out. They use action to prove that life is more than fiction, but the paradox is that it is a fictional story to express this view, and the plot is extremely exaggerated. Finally, the star mother used her life to make up for her daughter&#39;s owe, saying that life is not accurate enough, her life is going to end, it should be said that she sees a reputation heavier than life?? The female star became a murderer, she is negating her life. Career. For the daughter, she gave up everything completely, this is the deepest love. She admits to her fate, and her daughter is the &quot;family&quot; she can&#39;t hide in this life. She agrees with her daughter&#39;s practice. She wears a respirator and says, &quot;He (the daughter&#39;s husband) is so bad for us... you don&#39;t know how to get along with men.&quot; &quot;Mom, you teach me.&quot; Mother and daughter are in ambulance The final reconciliation in the car is touching. The mother returned to the basement where she lived. At that time, she should be a little girl who dreamed of becoming a big star. Now everything is empty. My mother has lived here since she returned to China. Maybe she felt something about her destiny. She wants to go back to the beginning, but everything can&#39;t be restarted. Seen from the window of the basement is a pair of feet, high-heeled shoes of various colors stepped on. There are many explanations for the symbol of high heels in the film, perhaps one more: the key props of the show. Being watched is the fate of women. This is the tragedy of the film. But performance and fiction also have the power of redemption, as is film, literature and art. Living is going to be played, changing one&#39;s identity, making up a story, my victory lies in your being deceived, the director isWe are throwing a wink, and the suspense transitions that make one after another make people dizzy. Anything in the business community can be sold, where do we go to find a true feeling. Maybe the truth no longer exists, or there is no pure tears. At the end of the tragedy, you smiled and left the scene with satisfaction. When you are sad next time, remember to &quot;think about me.&quot; &lt;watch movie midnight field&gt;2012 issue 12",movie

805,"The film depicting war from the perspective of human nature has always had a triple guarantee of artistic reputation, box office and awards. According to statistics, there are more than 20 Oscar-winning film awards involved in the war. As a Polish director Polanski who has experienced the life of the World War II concentration camp, his &quot;Pianist&quot; based on the real experience of the pianist Pearman, with its unique artistic aesthetic value, epic tragic temperament, human nature In-depth discussion, won the Oscar best director, best actor, best script adaptation award and won the Cannes Golden Palm Award, an unshakable position in the history of film. The producer of &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; once asked Polanski to direct the film, which was rejected by the memory rumors that he did not want to recall the suffering, and was eventually directed by Spielberg. Compare the &quot;Pianist&quot; with &quot;Sindel&#39;s List&quot;, which describes the history of the suffering of World War II by an artist&#39;s survival. The Schindler&#39;s List is double redeemed by a businessman (redeeming others, redeeming themselves) The inner heart) is more focused on the identity of God to carry out its description of World War II. The same two plots of the World War II film, the filming experience is very different, watching the &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;, the audience empathizes with Schindler, its high salvation road, the audience&#39;s viewing experience is God The feeling of sadness and sorrow. In the &quot;Pianist&quot;, the audience empathizes with Valle, whose survival in humiliation, the viewer&#39;s viewing and feelings are prisoner-like pain and struggle. The perspective problem is the skeleton of the entire film narrative. From what perspective the audience builds the story, from whom the eyes share the event, directly guides the viewer&#39;s value orientation and aesthetic orientation. The first third of Pianists pays attention to the survival of the whole family with Valle, while the latter two focuses on Valai&#39;s own survival. The structure of the chronicle is a structured way of omniscience. However, its perspective is not a purely omniscient structure. The main body of the film is described by Valle. There is no part of the film that appears in the film: in the opening paragraph of &quot;German is coming&quot;, the father is slapped; At the end of the &quot;German retreat&quot; paragraph, the officer is office, signing documents; friends meet German officers who help Valle; a few lyrical scenes (the film is temperate, the vast majority of lyrics are brought to the audience through the sight of Valle) . The advantage of the omniscient viewpoint is to increase the objectivity of the work and enhance the expressive power of the narrative; the defect is that the audience does not easily identify with the character, this omniscient view structure, and the narrative perspective is very focused on the protagonist (limited perspective)Slightly superb. The narrative method adopted by Schindler&#39;s List is intemperate. For example, a lot of music is paved. The entire film&#39;s Huacai passage is a big girl in a red dress. The little girl in red clothes walks in black and white movies. This scene and its scene Rendering. The narrative method of &quot;Pianist&quot; is temperate and calm. The subjective music in the film is not many times, and there are few close-ups. The music in the film is mostly the active music played by Valle, the overall narrative rhythm of Chopin&#39;s music and film. The content is very relevant. Both of these narrative methods can lead to pity of the audience. Polanski is more focused on finding the roots from the inside, and it is definitely a master in creating the atmosphere in the plot. In the passage of the Jewish quarter, the two appearances of the mad woman looking for her husband; the bearded man with a mental disorder asks the German To smoke; the tramps who robbed women porridge have achieved temperance but have a climax. After careful analysis of one of the scenes, Vale went home to rescue a boy who escaped from the Jewish quarter to find food. The younger brother said that a Jewish doctor rescued the patientâ€™s &quot;joke&quot; and the atmosphere in the family was frozen. In the middle of the night, the German officers came to the Jewish district for review and broke into a family opposite the Valle family. One of them had a disability and could not get up. The Germans continued, and the perspective of the vision (note, no advancement) fell. It was not finished yet. The family was driven down by the Germans and escaped on the empty street like a toy. Event connection events, event sublimation events, climax convergence or not, only this calm treatment can achieve such a good result. The most difficult thing to describe in a movie about World War II genre is the relationship between characters and characters. First, it cannot be a good model of both good and bad, and it cannot be too arrogant to the unjust side. The second is to lock the main characters, but also to outline the various aspects. Third, the choice of which character as the main character is a cautious and cautious question. The actions and choices of the main characters directly affect the audience&#39;s judgment on the war. Two of the more controversial typical examples are &quot;Jinling Thirteen&quot; and &quot;Sidek? Bale&quot;. The former fails. The main body of salvation is a foreign godfather and a group of prostitutes (although there is no problem in art and historical archetypes and creations). However, its value orientation is unacceptable to some people. At the same time, it is suspected of vilifying female students and beautifying prostitutes; the killing of the first half of the latterâ€™s Saideks is cruel, and the latter half weakens the sense of injustice of Japanese revenge. The identity of the Seykh people who were educated in Japan smashed the JapaneseRighteous war. Art and war are the two opposite nouns. One represents the beauty, and one skill is super-seeking the way of life of the spiritual world, but in the troubled times, the artistâ€™s survival is in the hands of the world. The impact is huge. The artist&#39;s view, the artist&#39;s choice in one event, the artist&#39;s ambiguity, is more weighty than the average person. Valle chose to stay in Poland when the family was ready to go; when the family was short of supplies, Valle chose to sell his own piano; Valle chose to help when he met a child who was beaten in the hole. Valle chose No when he asked him to join the Jewish police team; Valle went to the cafe to make money to supplement the family; Valle chose to go to the Jewish resistance organization (although not accepted); Valle helped the family get a work permit, fishing The younger brother who was rescued; when the younger brother and sister were taken away, the opening temptations of Valleâ€™s words to the mother first established an image of â€œhigh sense of justice and responsibilityâ€. When the whole family entered the train, he was saved by Heiz. Valle chose to survive after struggling and crying. This is a sudden change of the image of Valle. Valle was begging for mercy after being beaten; Valle turned to help his friend&#39;s escape; Valle&#39;s repeated avoidance; the transformation from an artist to a surviving person. After meeting the German officer&#39;s first performance of Valle (the first narrative of Chopin&#39;s description, describing the life of a wandering Polish) became the emotional node 2, the tears after the performance of Valle showed the mood at this moment. complex. Such a tall figure to the mutation of the &quot;humble&quot; character, sincerely complete the description of human nature. Valle is a grounded person, accepted and empathized by the audience. The audience completed the purification of humanity in the process of comparison. Valle is a lucky person, and this kind of luck is because the relationship has given him a safe network. The Jewish policeman Hez, who was given important protection to him, and he avoided the Jewish wealthy merchants in the restaurant. He helped him to contact Meyek in front of him to get a work permit, and the actress Jialinâ€™s family worshipped him. The cellist Dorota, and the German officers, most of them were killed. Among these people are so-called good and bad, so the description of the person is objective. The German officers did not have much descriptions, and they met after the defeat. They avoided the suspicion of the war criminals. At the same time, they also enriched the context of humanity. These Germans also have family members.They also hate war. Many of them are involuntarily, and the victims of the war are both sides. Including the people who assisted him and the sentient beings in the escape of Valle, enriched the expressiveness of the war. The more typical images have a woman who shouted how can I do this to kill her children, and argue whether to resist. The elderly, the vagrants who robbed the porridge, and the middle-aged women who were looking for their husband&#39;s mental disorders. At the same time, one-third of the film&#39;s inks describe the survival of the Valais family, so that in this movie, the survival of one person, one family, and a group of people is described, and the amount of information is quite rich. Humanity is a very broad concept, and it can better reflect human nature in war. Human beings are derived from animals and are different from animals. Humanity is actually a struggle between animal and divinity. War is like a catalyst, animal greed and ferocity, and the selflessness and goodness of divinity are portrayed. If the &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; is about the humanity theme of salvation from the perspective of the offender (Schindler&#39;s initial motive is to make a fortune in the war), then the &quot;Pianist&quot; humanity theme will be bigger and more objective. Survival is the first motive of man. Beauty and ugliness are the accompanying products. Good and evil are what you encounter. Hatred and greed lead to destruction, and tolerance is redeemed. &quot;Pianist&quot; stresses life, it is the difficulty of telling a living, it is said that it is born because of love. A single person is a character, a group of people is human, a single person cannot survive, a gathering has energy, or an energy of destruction, or an energy of salvation. This human context is in the destruction of a German and a person. Survival double contrast gives it an objective and profound meaning. At the end of the film, when Vale&#39;s colleagues reflected on the crazy behavior of the German criminals, they completed the film&#39;s interpretation of the war tragedy and humanity theme. After all, if resentment is an infinite cycle of war matrices, only tolerance and love can survive.",movie

807,"Finally, at the Phoenix Hotel in Guangzhou, I have time to read the last text of &quot;Zhang Cheo Tan Hong Kong Movie&quot;. This book was originally a Hong Kong version. It was bought in the late summer and early autumn with friends at the university bookstore of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It was a little discount with the student ID card but it is still expensive (compared to similar books in China), but it is the mainland. It has not yet been released, and it is the experience of Mr. Zhang Che. It is still tempting. When the bookstore closed, it was time to return, and the clerk explained that it would allow us to enter the store again. Originally thought to be a film review, or the life perception and record of Mr. Zhang Che&#39;s film. After reading the whole article, it turned out to be a history of oral film in Hong Kong. As a witness and a wave of people at this stage, Mr. Zhang Cheft interpreted the Hong Kong film from the perspective of the 50s and 80s from a personal perspective. He is not only a director but a film insider. And the words are more of a sense of responsibility and mission to Hong Kong movies, which is commendable. Basically, I think this is a history of Hong Kong film development for nearly 40 years. It has extremely valuable historical value and academic popularization. As an ordinary reader, it also has the opportunity to have a more comprehensive view of the development history and important historical nodes of the entire Hong Kong film, as well as the transition of the film art and film economy during the period. Mr. Zhang Che&#39;s text is concise and fluent, with clear ideas and clear views. The structure is rigorous and echoes, with a rare view of the overall situation, thinking that this is more reflected in his film, which also inspired me to have time to review Mr. Zhang Che&#39;s film to confirm. As for the text itself, there is nothing gorgeous, and the style is also straightforward. There is no trace of mud and water. It can be seen that it is a person who has the courage to do something, dare to do it, go straight and go without any details. I will not disclose the specific content of this book. I hope that friends who like Zhang Che film and Hong Kong movies have the opportunity to read this book. However, after reading this book, I hope to make a personal evaluation of Mr. Zhang Cheâ€™s film and film theory, or the movie point of view. As a Hong Kong film (including early in Shanghai, and later in Taiwan, mainland China), Zhang Che has worked as an actor, screenwriter, director, producer, film critic, and even composer. And as many as eighty-nine of the leading films, it is impossible to count them one by one. Among them, being the director is the most well-known and controversial experience, and it is also the part that everyone pays the most attention to. Many people have commented that Zhang Cheâ€™s films are large in number and bad in film. The content of the film is simple and straightforward, with a single subject matter, and the image expression is primitive and rough.The character role is barbaric and low-intelligence. With the major leaders of the same period, such as Li Hanxiang, Hu Jinqi, Chu Yuan, etc. can not be the same. I agree with some of these points, but I also want to comment a few more. Zhang Che can basically be regarded as a representative of a Hong Kong commercial film. This is the basis and starting point for evaluating his film industry experience. Starting from this point, many of the phenomena displayed inside and outside the &quot;Zhang Che film&quot; can basically explain. (Of course, I also admit that Li Hanxiang, Hu Jinqi, Chu Yuan, etc. are also commercial film directors, at least in part. But Zhang Che is basically a complete commercial film director, but does not prevent us from evaluating his film style and influence, just like evaluating Hitchcock. The same is true. First of all, it is a large number. As a commercial film director, the pursuit of quantity is a commercial goal. Moreover, Zhangâ€™s era is the era of Shawâ€™s, and it is the era of factory-made movies. This is basically a matter of time and heroes. Moreover, from the content of this book, Mr. Zhang Che&#39;s rise to the development and development of Shaw&#39;s factory-made production, the promotion of the martial arts film (martial arts film), and even the demand of Shao Yifu for Zhang Che&#39;s weight and marketization have contributed to To maintain a certain number of films, we must create an era and an era of prosperity. Therefore, it is inevitable that a single director or a certain film will evaluate Zhang Cheâ€™s director. Therefore, I hope that everyone can read this book and find more answers. But the rotten film is mostly, it is also an indisputable fact. I think it might be a bit of a reason. The internal cause may be in terms of personality. In fact, Mr. Zhang Che has also done a good self-evaluation in this book. He himself admits that his character is impulsive. Whenever he can catch or think of a little idea and idea, he will put it into practice. Realize, not pay attention to details, only take big heads. This is similar to the text of this book. The discovery of this book is that Zhang Cheâ€™s overall view is very strong. The text of the book is like a rushing Hong Kong film history. The readers sit quietly on the big boat and look at the whole magnificent. The forty-year history of the picture, and the broken waves are fleeting even if they break into the field of vision. The external cause is also related to Zhang Che&#39;s character. In his time, he was anxious to express his disdain for the past Huangmei film. He hoped that one day he could swept the shadow of the film, which coincided with Mr. Shao Yifu, two of them. Itâ€™s a hit. Although Zhang Che took a lot of bad films, he used his huge amount of bad films to express his personal style. Among them, the return of male characters in the film is a huge contribution, and it has even changed the history of Hong Kong movies in the future. Given that Huang Mei adjusted the film atBefore, in order to return to the importance of male characters, Zhang Che would rather stand on the reverse side of Huang Mei&#39;s film, and there is a strong personal branding image style, such as the determination of the type of martial arts. In fact, Zhang Che personally has no relationship with martial arts. It is not like the movie characters who influence Hong Kong martial arts films such as Bruce Lee, Liu Jialiang, Yuan Heping and his son, Cheng Xiaolong and his son, and Jackie Chan&#39;s family. For example, in order to express the staunchness and heroism of male characters, it is customary to use the expression of shirtlessness. This method directly transfers the viewer from the singer of Huangmei to the stimulating hormone. The strong contrast will be Zhangâ€™s concept. Play to the extreme. There are also wheel wars to show tragic, the hero&#39;s death to deepen the viewer&#39;s emotional input, the use of slow motion to enhance the character&#39;s tragic, even splicing, soundtrack, close-up, etc., everything will be Zhang&#39;s strong movie views And with a personal style of performance. This is not simply a question of the expressive power of the film. This is a high expression of personal values â€‹â€‹and outlook on life. These views in this book, Zhang Che have made a detailed statement and interpretation. Another perspective of reading this book is Zhang Che to see people. Mr. Zhang Che has experienced some historical periods because of his personal life experience. As a leader, he has the opportunity to contact all aspects of the characters. He went to Shao Shi Jiahe boss Shao Yifu and Deng Wenhuai. To directors Li Hanxiang, Hu Jintao, Xu Ke, Wu Yusen, etc., to the major movie stars Jiang Dawei, Dillon, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Xu Guanwen, etc., he can make a personal evaluation of these people in a concise and objective manner, objective and fair, accurate and in place, and humane. From this point of view, it is quite interesting to see the other side of these characters, and to see Mr. Zhang Cheâ€™s style of doing things as a mirror. Finally, what I want to mention is Mr. Zhang Cheeâ€™s motherland and his love of movies. This book was written in 1988, when Zhang Che was 66 years old and didn&#39;t make any more films. However, Mr. Zhang Cheâ€™s proposal and expectation of the cultural return of the three sides of the strait and the concept of the big Chinese film is worthy of deep consideration and admiration by all practitioners. When reviewing Huang Mei&#39;s film and martial arts movies, Mr. Zhang Che repeatedly mentioned the archaeological allusions and story prototypes in the book. On the one hand, Zhang Che&#39;s rigorous intentions on the subject matter of the film, and on the other hand, Zhang Che&#39;s love for traditional Chinese culture. . Recently, I also read the essays of Mr. Hu Jintao and found that the famous martial arts films have a lot of experience and research on traditional history and culture, literature and history allusions, martial arts heritage, and Beijing opera.Research, and more in the film art to learn from and apply. The love of Chinese culture and the inheritance of physical practice are the roots of the rich feelings of the family of this generation of filmmakers. The acceptance of modern civilization and the use of it for me are the realistic expression of the self-improvement of professionalism in Hong Kong filmmakers. There are strong skills that are the example that my generation has learned. Zhang Che&#39;s book not only allows readers to understand the ins and outs of the rise and development of Hong Kong films, but also vividly interprets the connection between his personal and works, and makes the film-loving practitioners or audiences more passionate about and contribute to the film. The enthusiasm of life.",movie

809,"In terms of classification, economics can be simply divided into theoretical economics and practical economics. The latter belongs to the reality of economics in the eyes of Ronald Coase. In realistic economics, economists no longer stick to the formula calculations and arguments in the study, but go to the real world and watch the world with their eyes. The economics are unpredictable, measuring the depth of the story behind the goods with the footsteps. Such behavior also provides sufficient material for the case study of theoretical economics. The Irish economist Kona Woodman is such a best example. Through his own efforts, he bravely walked out of the study, facing the vast world, and constantly enriching his own logic. This time, he also presented the book &quot;Doing business with the world 2: What are you buying?&quot; as the best proof of his own world. Although it is an economics book that walks the world, it is different from the simple form of travel, because the book is deeply immersed in the author&#39;s deep thinking, and these stories are mostly people belonging to third world countries. Commodities are one of the most familiar words. Every day, we buy a variety of goods. However, what is hidden behind the back of each product, whether the moral character of the label on those goods can be truly realized, and the poverty of people in the third world countries can really get rid of through the purchase of goods. This series of questions is undoubtedly the question that the author has to answer through his own steps. And he can lead by example, from the study to the reality, one step at a time, measuring every inch of land with actual actions, and talking with people from different industries in different underdeveloped countries, many conclusions are drawn: the so-called big enterprises The social responsibility, especially the ethical label posted on the goods, is often overhead and monopolized. The people who really need help have not changed the status quo. The real change of the status quo is still a large enterprise. Therefore, this forms a kind of &quot;Transaction&quot;, let morality kidnap people&#39;s judgment. The author&#39;s footsteps range from Latin America to the Far East, from Central Asia to Central Africa, and back to Africa. In this process, he witnessed the story behind poverty, how the goods that were separated from the workers or fishermen of poor third-world countries entered the people&#39;s sights through the processing of large enterprises. &quot;Drinking this cup of coffee, you can help improve the lives of the villagers in Buzamanga, Uganda.&quot; This is a text from a coffee cup. This kind of text is no stranger to anyone, because you can see it at chain stores like KFC and McDonald&#39;s. you areSimilar slogans can be seen on the labels of many well-known domestic products. It is true that helping disadvantaged groups is part of the social responsibility of large companies. However, when the author really goes deep into the real world, it is discovered that such corporate responsibility has not been realized at all, and those who are poor are still poor. This is the weight of the goods, but people did not realize the truth when they bought it. Every story is so touching and touching. It is related to the moral logic of the commodity world. Through the author&#39;s personal practice, it is expressed by the author&#39;s real brushstrokes, which allows all people to glimpse the true face behind the goods. Although these are just the form of the case, whether it is the status of industrial industry in China&#39;s Foxconn or the fishermen on the coastline of Ecuador, the stories of these people carry the heavy goods. The goods in their hands have entered the lives of people through the operation of large enterprises. In every link, moral goods have become a key word. How many people are buying goods according to the word &quot;moral&quot;? ? On the coffee cup, I saw the bitter eyes of the children in the African village, and the compassion of the life to put the goods into the shopping basket. However, the status quo of poverty involves the social responsibility of enterprises, and it is obviously unethical to exchange such eyes for the marketing of goods.",movie
810,"No matter whether it is foreign or domestic, there is no shortage of books in the market. It is inspirational books. In these books, a very similar logic is how you can be happy, how to be successful, how to be more efficient, and so on. However, how much inspirational creeds extracted from these inspirational books can help, how many people can help out of the bottom of life and embark on the peak of career? If you blindly believe in such an inspirational creed, you will undoubtedly fall into the trap of blind obedience and disappear. Therefore, it is necessary to uncover the fog of these inspirational creeds and let people see the absurdity behind them. In such a book of disclosure, &quot;Unreliable Pseudo-Psychology&quot; can be regarded as a unique path. It does not tell too much truth, but analyzes the myths of inspirational creed one by one; it does not say that the motivational creed is not credible, but only analyzes the weaknesses from the perspective of facts. One of the drawbacks of the inspirational creed is &quot;well known&quot;, but as Mr. Lu Xun said, &quot;It has always been, is it right?&quot; The same is true of the inspirational creed, just because its &quot;well known&quot; has an infinite market. But what hides behind the â€œwell-knownâ€ is the weakness of these inspirational creeds called â€œpsychological proverbsâ€, which are generally naive and naive, simplifying complex problems and tending to be non-black or white. The means of solving problems are simple and simple, such as &quot;Don&#39;t be painful&quot;, &quot;Life wants to pursue happiness&quot;, &quot;Give me what I want&quot;, &quot;Make me stronger&quot; and so on. This kind of treatment is obviously clear-cut, that is, in order to gain more believers, open up more markets, and regain confidence in those who are at a low point in life. Confidence can be regained, but often only confidence is not enough, because things need to be down-to-earth rather than verbal explanations. In foreign countries, &quot;Human weaknesses&quot; and &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; have been widely spread, affecting the way many people behave in behaviors; the books that have been successfully studied in China are full of enthusiasm and become the Bible of the youth. However, such an inspirational story has violated one of the most classic mistakes, which is to simplify people. Imagine that there is no one-size-fits-all truth in this world. The so-called success and inspirational stories are just a person&#39;s experience and lessons. If such a so-called experience and lesson is called &quot;human weakness&quot; &quot;Is it too hurried?&quot; How complicated is human nature, can it be summarized in a book? Since it cannot be generalized, such asIf people believe in such a creed, they will inevitably encounter a moment when they hit the wall. So, don&#39;t take the inspirational creed too seriously, just look at one of the books, don&#39;t listen to the creed and swear it. Why does the â€œpsychological proverbâ€ of inspirational creed have a market? This is easy to explain, mainly because the motivational creed is too simple, it is too easy to confuse people&#39;s hearts, to imagine success as something that everyone can do, to regard life happiness as an act that everyone can do. This is like spiritual heroin, which can temporarily paralyze people&#39;s minds and put them in a state of high excitement. But people can&#39;t be in such excitement forever, they must have a moment to fall, and that time is a sober moment. &quot;Unreliable pseudo-psychology&quot; is to point out the fallacies in these inspirational creeds, so that people can see their true faces in close quarters, can&#39;t be confused by them, and can&#39;t let them be confused. Otherwise, they will eliminate themselves and lose their way. It will become a necessity, and I believe that the inspirational creed will become no longer trying to be down-to-earth and become high-minded.",movie

(Alice pulled her into the pants~~) As if I was Alice in front of me, I am looking forward to my own story. After that, I talked about Matia. The solitude of Matthias has a lot to do with the disappearance of his sister. The girl is missing, he didn&#39;t cry. It was like this since childhood. I have never had much communication with the outside world. I have a lot to say about Matia&#39;s character. When I first knew that he was this character, my first reaction turned out to be &quot;This baby is going to suffer in China.&quot; I thought about the &quot;worry&quot; for John Nash when I first saw the beautiful heart (well, admit A little bit polluted by our society.) The last thing I can&#39;t accept is someone with mental illness. Alone people have more or less of them, but I like to watch their stories. They are not willing to show their ability to show it deliberately. When everyone sees their light, they all have admiration and hopelessness. I am interested in how he handles the circle of life as a lonely person. After reading the story of Matia, I suddenly felt lonely and especially appreciated him. Few people can have the wisdom that is comparable to him; few people can have the same calmness as him; few people can love his girlfriend without being married for the same purpose. It is also that the man and the woman are not husband and wife, and the love between each other is deep like the sea.

Still deliberate marketing means. In short, it is very good to see. The story is simple. Some people say that it is plagiarism. I am not very opposed. After all, story creation and architecture are very similar. Wang Leqing played by Guo Caijie is a girl who looks good. There is a job that looks good. Have a very good boyfriend. In order to surprise your boyfriend. She took a trip with the photographer who played the role of Fang Zu. Everything happened during the trip. Let her finally understand what she wants. The overall color of the movie is gorgeous. The selection is extremely beautiful. sunny. The catkins fly. The whole picture is really beautiful. The story takes place in Yangmei Town. The place is in Guangzhou. I don&#39;t know if I can satisfy the logic of the story. I have not scrutinized here. Just think that the scenery is beautiful. The filming of the movie is very powerful. But did not find out who it is. It should be a Taiwanese photographer. However, the art director of this film is the famous Jiao Xiong screen in Taiwan. Therefore, the style of the whole film should be a small fresh feeling of Taiwanese classics. In the film, Guo Caijie was very beautiful. There are many shots showing her most beautiful side. If you intercept some. Make a special feature of Guo Caijie. Absolutely no worse than any one. The shortcomings of the film are still quite obvious. It can be described as a bad injury. The first to bear the brunt is the acting of the two major stars. Guo Caijie just came out and is not known for his acting skills. But because of the temperament of that special little girl. Very performances are impressive. Especially the rich girl in Love. That paragraph is unforgettable. After that, I donâ€™t know who is the perfect woman who is suitable for the kind of gas field.

The acting of Fang Zuming has always been above the level. I don&#39;t know if I want to play against Guo Caijie. At least this performance is before his level. second. The development of the story is too sudden. I don&#39;t know if it is a limitation of the duration of the movie. In Guo Caijie&#39;s decision to break up the paving too little. After six months, I became an ex-boyfriend. How much will make people feel a little sudden. third. The film deliberately added a family cue. But they are not willing to describe it with too much ink. It seems a bit prominent. Is this onlyIs it to increase the advantages of the family name? But I like the thoughts or values â€‹â€‹expressed in this movie. In fact, it is simple. Itâ€™s just a question of â€œnot badâ€ and â€œI like itâ€. You have been following the rules of life. You accept people and things that look &quot;not bad&quot; in others. You never thought about whether these things are &quot;I like it&quot;. Maybe we are too step-by-step. Not so many accidents. But have you ever thought that something is getting so suddenly. Not arranged well. In the movie, Wang Leqing was touched by the moment and got up in the morning. Someone can send breakfast to the bedside. In fact, she already understood what she wanted during her journey. Otherwise she won&#39;t go home with the cheap flat shoes. I don&#39;t know for a woman. She is more willing to have a pair of luxury heels that are not so fit. Still willing to wear a pair of flat shoes that are comfortable to wear. There is no right or wrong choice at all. The important thing is that. What is &quot;I like it&quot; in the end. There is a line in the film that particularly touches me. That was said before the two people separated. I wrote to write it down. Recorded on Weibo. &quot; Don&#39;t be shy in the future. Follow the feelings. Someone will love you.&quot; I don&#39;t know if he saw her kindness. Or it is not comfortable. She has to do so much for each date. Arrange so much deliberate. Do so much waiting. Maybe these are not just shy. and so. It should be followed. Not trying to bring the less suitable marriage ring. Instead, sit on the ground and accompany him to play the game that may seem boring (in my opinion, the game is really blasting. Is it me also a otaku? Silk. Haha). Many people say that this movie is nothing more than the story of Bai Fumei being chased by his hand during his travels. I particularly disagree with this statement. The film itself has paved the way for this. Wang Leqing may be the kind of Bai Fumei that everyone thinks. But Zhou Tong is definitely not? Silk. Have thoughts. Willing to persist. filial piety. careful. If you must take money as a benchmark. So what is this benchmark? I really like the move before he left. Make a sculpture of two people riding bicycles with a pile of waste. That is also the happiest moment of their journey. He used it to express his mind. He is waiting for her. If she is willing to find her. I don&#39;t know for you. What is love like. But I will only love you in the way that I think is the best.

I always felt that some curses were inside, but I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it. I decided to write it. Happy because the film tells us to let it go, and to get life without any effort, which is a good news for my current state. Sadly, David paid everything, sacrificed so much, and selflessness, kindness, justice, and the final end is the double injury of mentality, which is unfair to him. And the film is not the one who has taken the last step in the whip, but he has gone all out with respect to those who have never worked hard, not to mention how he can know what the future looks like. How can he know if there is a monster or a rescuer? Maybe because you don&#39;t know, you shouldn&#39;t fight hard. And this is a painful place, because most of them are the latter, fight for it and give up. I used to think that the extreme is wrong. The film seems to say that the extreme is correct, the fight to the end, and the hard work, will have a happy ending? This is not true. Analyze the film: First of all, the appearance of monsters, according to Amor&#39;s statement, is that humans should not rob God of the task, to study life, drugs, and then put in the monsters of different worlds. Then Amor said that he killed the second class, and there would be no monsters at night, and it was fulfilled. Then Amor did not let everyone out, Orly killed her, and then went to the first to die. In the end everyone died, and David collapsed, but those who believed in God survived. Amor is not recognized by the mainstream. Maybe she is like a mental patient in reality, but the supermarket manager does not believe in David. David does not believe in Amor. Does the author tell us to look at the film objectively? It seems that every little story shows that it is the best to go with the flow. This is the place that I can&#39;t understand. Maybe it breaks the convention of the film. If the evil is not correct, the person will win the day, and the effort will have the harvest, but the theme of the performance. It is self-deprecating and pessimistic. Finally, I want to say that such a movie is enough to see once, and it will be crazy if you look at it. Also protect the environment and be alert to smog.",movie
825,"To the youth we will die, So Young (2013) to the youth we will die. So Young (2013) is a very popular domestic movie this year. After Bluray, I quickly watched it. The movie story tells the love of several college students, and they are all &quot;female chasing men.&quot; The characters in the film have their own stories: 1. Beauty Zheng Wei came to the city to go to school to follow the childhood friend Lin Jing, but Lin Jing secretly left because of his father and Zheng Weiâ€™s mother. Zheng Wei is very sad. Later, Zheng Wei met a poor college student, Chen Xiaozheng, who did not put her in her eyes. The two became deadly enemies because of misunderstanding, but Zheng Wei found that he liked him for a long time. Therefore, Zheng Xiaoâ€™s stalking pursuit of Chen Xiaozheng, after several offensives such as spoiling, dating, and singing, the two finally became lovers. The university passed quickly in the past four years. When he graduated, Chen Xiaozheng abandoned Zheng Wei to the United States for his own future. In this way, Zheng Wei lived alone after graduation. One day, Zheng Wei met Lin Jing, and the two chatted about the past, but she did not want to forgive him. At the same time, Chen Xiaozheng also returned from the United States, but also to save Zheng Wei, she also did not forgive her. However, after Zheng Weiâ€™s best friend, Dongguan, died in a car accident, she hurriedly asked her first love boyfriend to marry herself. Later, Zheng Wei learned that a woman like herself was crazy about Lin Jing, and she sneaked away. Zheng Wei left a letter to Lin Jing, let her cherish this woman. 2. Zheng Wei Room Friends is a beautiful woman who is more beautiful than Zheng Wei. She is gentle and kind, looks perfect, but she has a first love boyfriend who is not worth her love. My boyfriend forgives other women, returns to his hometown for work, has no guts to have children, and so on. He forgives and helps him. After graduating, he also gave him a miscarriage and gave up his child. But this incident made him completely lose confidence in his boyfriend, and then he got to know a man who can marry. When the two men were about to hold a wedding, the boyfriend invited her to go to Beijing to watch the concert. I agreed, but she was killed on the way to the concert because of a car accident. 3. Another roommate of Zheng Wei, Li Weijuan, is from a small county town. He studies hard every day and does not pay boyfriends. But one day, a migrant worker came to the girls&#39; dormitory to find Li Weijuan. He turned out to be the boyfriend whom Li Weijuan met when he re-read. However, after Li Weijuan saw him, he made it clear that the two could not be together. He asked him to leave after eating.. After graduating, Li Weijuan made a big money, started as a stepmother for two children, and actively gave birth to his children. 4. Zheng Xiaoâ€™s third roommate, Zhu Xiaobei, is a self-respecting girl and behaves like a boy. Once, Zhu Xiaobei was mistaken for a thief when he was shopping. The clerk and the boss wanted to search for it. Zhu Xiaobei refused, so he fought. After the school, Zhu Xiaobei apologized, Zhu Xiaobei, who thought that he was right, refused to do so, and slammed the contents of the store with a sigh of relief, so that Zhu Xiaobei was dropped out of school. After graduation, Zhu Xiaobei changed his name to Liu Yun and became a very successful lecturer. When the old classmate recognized Zhu Xiaobei, she concealed her identity. 5. Zheng Wei and the two boys Zhang Kai and Xu Kaiyang are good buddies. During the university, Xu Kaiyang liked Zheng Wei, but was refused, and Zhang Kai had been secretly stunned and had been secretly giving flowers, but neither of them had any results until graduation. After graduation, Xu Kaiyang married Zeng Wei who liked Chen Xiaozheng and gave up his opportunity to go abroad. When you open it, you can&#39;t do anything, and you can write a biography on the street. However, Zhang has always liked to swear, and she will secretly send flowers to her after her death. The above is the movie plot, which shows that this is a rich movie. This movie made me very emotional: Isn&#39;t this film about my college life and my life? So this movie made me very &quot;objective&quot;, because a movie that describes my life will really affect my viewing experience. I can&#39;t stand in the perspective of a bystander like a movie. Come to comment. Therefore, I don&#39;t know what to say, just write the contents of the movie that remind me of my memories. The protagonists of this film are all after eighty, talking about their life in the 1990s. Most of the details in the film have restored my student life, such as the costumes and styling of the characters in the film, the furnishings in the bedroom, the layout on the campus, the living environment outside the campus, and so on. All of this truly presented the university campus in the mid-to-late 1990s. The dialogue in the film, the emotions expressed by the actors, also have the traces of the era of the 1990s. For example, the first love of the childhood, the attitude of the game, these are the characteristics of college students in the late 1990s. Because only after 80 years, it has emerged from the cities with low economic and cultural development in the fast-growing big cities. The innocence has immediately turned into a fallen youth! In summary, we can know that the film editors have vividly reproduced the story and the era in which the characters live. It is a qualified &quot;nostalgic film.&quot; Of course, it alsoLet me this &quot;player&quot; recall my college time, can you not feel it? Although the film makes me &quot;nostalgic&quot;, the film story is quite clichÃ©. To be simple, you can sum it up in one sentence: the love that we will die and the boys we chased together in those years, ..., very speechless. Therefore, aside from the nostalgic outer shell of the film, the content of the movie is just a few pairs of love and love for men and women and their compromise on real life after graduation, how modeled! Therefore, this film is not a perfect movie, nor a good movie. Of course, this is from an objective point of view. If I comment on my subjective point of view, this film is still very good, at least the emotion in the film infected me! It can be seen that there is a variety of evaluations in a movie. Different viewpoints and feelings will be different. The filming was quite satisfactory, but it was not easy for the newly-launched director Zhao Wei. Of course, the film is still a bit embarrassing, mainly because when the story goes to college, the story becomes very messy, and the connection between different characters and different things is very leaping, which makes me look awkward. Perhaps this film is &quot;harmonized&quot;? If there is a director&#39;s cut, the situation may be much better. Finally, we must praise the picture, lighting and color of the film. The yellow and warm colors are in line with the movie theme, and it looks very enjoyable. This is a rare color in Chinese movies. The actors are very good. In addition to Zhao Youting, the stars in the film are all little-known actors. However, under the adjustment of Zhao Wei and Guan Jinpeng, they all show the unique charm of the character itself, which is amazing. From here, I feel that there are too many talents in China, but there is a lack of Bole and opportunities. There are two beautiful women in the film, one is Yang Zishan, the other is Jiang Shuying, both young and beautiful. In addition to these two, I don&#39;t feel anything about the appearance of other people in the film. They are just ordinary people who look like Peugeot, so I won&#39;t say it. As for Han Geng, I donâ€™t even feel it. Will he act? in conclusion. This is a movie that recalls memories after the 80s. Although the story is ordinary, there is finally a movie reflecting this age. I am still very satisfied. So.Young.2013.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi",movie
826,"Although it became part of the title, there was no chance of playing. Itâ€™s rare to have excellent performance on the court, and itâ€™s like being spurred by these fools. Although it is said to be a brisk work, it is as the writer himself said that while letting some people enjoy happiness, it exposes the status quo of most Japanese men. Nothing you want, even people who donâ€™t want to be clear, even shouted &quot;Run, Takahashi!&quot; as a curse. It seems that everything can be solved. The truth is Their messy life will not change. As Takahashi, if you know that you have become a boring bet, you will feel helpless. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t treat me as an excuse to solve the aftermath of that thing.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but design such a line for Takahashi. But it may not. After all, it is a good person who sent black sugar from the training ground. I went to the Internet to check the photos. It doesn&#39;t seem to be particularly handsome (it might not be the type I like). But especially able to understand &quot;walking with idols&quot;, even if everyone has spent the same time, the traces left by them in the years are always more obvious, and they are used as a comparison of their own lives. The benchmark for progress. The male characters selected by Murakami are clearly dealing with the problem of poor self-esteem. Either the excess self-esteem leads to psychological distortion, or it is self-destruction and nothing to do. Guys with sullen faces and muddy waters. The unclear and weird impression left on the streets of Japan at that time was probably the grievances that tens of millions of people vomited because of the problem of handling bad dignity. Even the Prince Hotel stood there with a look that was not self-confident, watching the pedestrians who were rushing past the windbreaker on the road. &quot;Because human beings need self-confirmation, troubles are dead, like dignity or something.&quot; &quot;The so-called self-esteem, is not to know yourself very well, can&#39;t do things that clearly can&#39;t be done?&quot; It is only clear where their boundaries are. The machine is the cutest, Borges. Obviously, they are helpless things, but they must be described in a pretending tone. The male characters in Murakamiâ€™s pens are such logic. Like this popular writer who accidentally fell in love with counterfeit goods and used his own identity to seduce the hotel girl, he clearly chose the direction of love at first sight, but could not help but use scientific probabilistic methods to solve the stagnant relationship between himself and the girl. . Finally, the machine just gave a plan to go to baseball. completeActually, people can&#39;t get thirsty things through methods they don&#39;t believe. Reliable people are the most precious in this world, but they have to bear the troubles of most irresponsible people. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a deliberate arrangement: from the ignorant ignorance to the person who can think rationally and solve the trouble alone, maybe the writer&#39;s expectation of these breathing-stricken guys may be. Fortunately, I am a more animated woman, it is great to see such encouragement.",movie
827,"Hey, as a flower idiot, can DiCaprio&#39;s movie be missed, of course not. As a major production adaptation of the world&#39;s famous works, can you miss it? In principle, you can&#39;t. I can&#39;t miss the brain powder that I like a combination of handsome men and women, and I can&#39;t. For three reasons, I watched this movie. Looking at so many movies in the horizontal and vertical, the story is getting more and more ups and downs, and the more you can get the applause. The story is simple, and a high-ranking handsome is turned to pursue the story of an ex-girlfriend who has become a woman. Such a simple story purpose (do not try to catch up with the ex-girlfriend does not stop), but can get countless flowers applause, in addition to the uncle of the uncle, the poor boy through the unscrupulous struggle, once finally become a predator, temper Ang, the big arrogant standing in front of his ex-girlfriend, the extravagant and eager attempt to recover her. Such an inspirational story is about to give a little heart to the man. Hollywood big production, you should not have to emphasize the unparalleled scene of beauty. But the beautiful, sexy and elegant costumes of the 20th century are worth emphasizing. Every dress of the heroine is a fantasy of women in the closet. Former girlfriends, rivals, mansions... These are the foils of Gatsby, setting off the glory of his unremitting efforts, even his dirty and illegal money, have been praised by the world. And Tom, this white man, he is an admirer of Gatsby, only he is deeply in love with Gatsby.",movie
828,"About two people will be split in the body, assuming two. They will talk to different people at the party full of people, smile brightly, then see each other at a moment and see each other. It is like being yourself in a parallel world. Frances and Sophie are like Vicky and Cristina of Vicky Cristina Barcelona, â€‹â€‹but more like the same person. We are potentially other ourselves. But not everyone can find the ideal moment of life like Frances. Frances may be me in another place. She is fortunate to have close friends, good things, and persistent ideals. Not everyone can hold them to the end. Just as the film started shortly, we saw a stable life that Frances did not want to give up, and it collapsed in a conversation. Sophie wants to move to a favorite environment and live close to Frances, even though the latter would rather break up with her boyfriend than to betray her inner preferences. Separated but can not blame separation. Frances will try to win the opportunity to perform, will be very happy to receive the tax rebate, and be proud to hear it is missing... very simple. Even these things make her look awkward and fail. When she was alone, she met new friends and chatted with them, but she felt that she was not here. Always saying something cold and cold, it looks like an element that should not appear here, can&#39;t fit into everything. But everything she said was sincere. The world listens to her but does not have to respond to her. Because of this, we always feel that we are too alone, and that even the news of intimate people must pass through the mouth of others. The business is frustrated, the appointment is incompetent, and the friends are far away. Even if they travel to the streets of foreign countries, they still have nowhere to go. They wander around or sleep all day, and they are like a lonely patient. So grateful, there is a home to return. You can hide in the bright light. Some people just can&#39;t open their attachments, like Frances. Rejecting the company&#39;s clerical work is to not give up the dance dream. Back to school part-time, but also for the enthusiasm and care that I used to be familiar with. In fact, many people like Sophie can&#39;t open a lot of love, but they can only hide in the coma after drinking. Frances told Sophie on the streets of foreign countries that he was very good. The photos of the Sophie blog say their satisfaction. Everyone has a right choice for their choice.The sorrow and tolerance of the time, the deceitful relief of the choices that have been abandoned and the pride of not admitting defeat: don&#39;t worry, Ah, I am fine. At the school ball, two close people reunited. Originally, they all had troubles and did not talk, and they could not open the reality and ideals of perfect combination before they were separated. Sophie said that he hopes to stay with Frances and rebuild it. But Frances, who woke up in the morning, had only a message that she couldnâ€™t remember what she said and she couldnâ€™t stop. Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact is that the reality of opening up is hard to turn back. Frances can&#39;t catch up with the real car with bare feet running. No matter how many times there have been pleasant runs. But this is the story about Frances Ha, and you can always find a story about where you live. Finally, her choreographed dances were staged and appreciated, friends were present and satisfied, and the same &quot;dating incompetence&quot; had a potential future and found the ideal state of life. Get the place I always wanted (presumably while being happy with Sophie&#39;s life, she is still waiting for Sophie to have her own time and say &quot;Let&#39;s go home&quot;). It is a kind of inspirational film for people who like to look wrong. Of course, it is also a relief piece for the intellectual side. Frances said: &quot;I like things that look like mistakes.&quot; Things that look like mistakes are like the ideals she has always adhered to, the way she obeys reality. Some of the forks can&#39;t catch up, and some will fall. But that is not a mistake. In the film, Frances arranged the dance to make everyone move. In the possible combination of people and people, where is the right place, who is the best partner? We may join hands together in the last section, but some people walk away and some people can&#39;t leave. Someone is embracing you with enthusiasm, but you have to stay back in a hug. Someone has been determined to walk towards you, but they have definitely turned and walked away... They all danced at their own pace, and had the privilege of synchronizing their partners, but the songs will end. Impressed by Frances, I saw the clumsy self and hope to get a good ending.",movie
829,"Look at &quot;Cloud Map&quot; and know about Dou Na. So I found this one and completed the download on June 8. On November 9th, I will watch it. It is said that it is a three-level film. Throughout the whole film, there are only a few dew spots on the chest. It is not the same thing as the third-level film in the usual sense. There is a theme about loneliness, there is a little bit.

Before the death, the old man touched the head of the womanâ€™s forehead and said: People say that the hands of the ice have a warm heart.

It is still necessary to visit insects and breeze, and the relationship between pistils and stamens is related. In essence, life has an important lack of it and is perfected by the existence of the other. However, we are unconscious and have not been told about each other&#39;s important lack of self.

830,"From the story itself, the structure is rigorous and the plot is compact, but I donâ€™t know if there are many stories that imitate the Tale of Two Cities. I always feel that there is not much new idea in the plot. The story tells the approximation of the appearance of Charles and Kathy very early. As for the appearance of the card in Paris in the latter part of the story, I immediately thought of his intention to replace Charles to die; but to put the story in the background of the French Revolution, but it does not mean: mention the French Revolution, Almost everyone will think of Eugenâ€™s &quot;Freedom to Guide the People&quot;. The Statue of Liberty is waving the tricolor flag in the right hand. The classic image of the left hand holding a weapon calling for everyone to rise up and rebelling has laid the foundation for the &quot;freedom, equality, and fraternity&quot; of the French Revolution in the hearts of the world. But I think &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot;, but more describes the enthusiasm and loss of reason in the riots, as if they have been brainwashed. Perhaps all bottom-up revolutions are like this. It is these impulses and irrationalities that bring great power to break through the fear of death and to spread a new path with blood; but we Never know, is this a new group of oppressors to replace the old oppressors? After the main characters of the story gathered in Paris, Dickens spent a lot of time to describe the masses&#39; loss of reason, and the Xia Da couples were almost perfect, a benevolent and a perfect, a gentle and beautiful (of course, believe big Some people still like to devote themselves to love and become a card of others. But these two characters seem to lack personality. The vicissitudes of the doctor, the determination, and the inclusiveness of the daughter for the happiness of the daughter are the symbols of the &quot;boss&quot; of the Great Revolution. Mr. Lorry is a typical British gentleman. He is mature and stable. He has worked hard all his life and has a kind heart with his duty. Pros is one of my favorite characters. It is awkward, not beautiful but has outstanding personality. Although it is only a servant, it makes people love it. In the end, I intend to let go of my righteousness, and to stop the bravery of Mrs. Defa Day is really admirable. It is perhaps the best ending for Dickens to arrange her deafness. Such a simple, kind person should not hear the noisy and ugly world, forget the life she lost, and she can live happily. As for Cathy, this is a person who is so inferior in front of love. From the beginning, he conveyed his concern for Lucy to Xia Da in the courtroom. After drunk, he couldnâ€™t help but reveal his love for Lucy in front of his loved ones. In the meantime, when Xia Da was sentenced to death again, he took Lucy to the carriage, and then he decided to replace Xia Da in prison. This role is fromPeople hate to sympathize with others, and then to be liked, I believe that many people are touched by his selfless love. However, from another point of view, I originally imagined that Dickens would describe a fierce and wonderful dialogue when he and Xia Da changed their status. As a result, he was full of wisdom and directly fainted Xia Da to send him out, and made all arrangements to prevent the dew. West is embarrassed to him, I really admire his tolerance, his weight, his atmosphere. I don&#39;t think this is purely supportive to the goddess&#39; love (not to mention the fact that Lucy in the story has no other prominent features except for beauty and filial piety). This should be Card&#39;s insistence on faith, just like the sentence in the book. Said, &quot;What I am doing now is a great thing, far better than what I have always done. I am going to a good home, far better than I have always known.&quot;++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The very positive and optimistic QQ signature of the younger brother is â€œIt was the best of timesâ€.

When I saw it, I asked Have you been alive, is this age that I am alive? We didn&#39;t understand the turmoil, we couldn&#39;t experience the turbulence of history, but I think we lived in a time when &quot;best and worst&quot; was the most difficult to divide. As a student who is trying to find a job, he is often full of embarrassment about a new life. He is always willing to think of it very well. But from time to time, he is followed by reality, and he is filled with &quot;houses, cars, tickets, The child...&quot; is oppressed and always feels that this is a rather obsessive era of worst. . . It is as if we are thinking about Beijing&#39;s cultural atmosphere and traditional architecture, and constantly cursing its pollution, blockage, and high housing prices; when we want to leave, we feel that it is the best, and we want to stay and feel that it is so harsh and strict. However, I am willing to think this way. In fact, everyone living in the moment will feel that this is the worst of times (just like the history of the &quot;Midnight Paris&quot;, the hero and the protagonist feel that they have not experienced the golden age), but each Doesn&#39;t all of the worst of times happen in the worst of times?

831,"The longest piece of Woody Allen (124 minutes) so far. This Woody self-proclaimed favorite is actually not Woody. It is said that this film is not Woody, because the film runs through a strong sense of horror from beginning to end, which is far from the Wuyi comedy marked by words. The protagonist Chrisâ€™s preconceived image of the sun easily won the audienceâ€™s goodwill and sympathy, and he was always sweating for his derailment; even after he sneaked away and murdered, I still hoped that he would not be discovered by the savvy inspector. . This used to be the experience of Hitchcock or David Lynch. In the end, the director seemed to satisfy the audience, and an incredible coincidence changed the judgment of the inspector; but such a black humorous ending caused the audience to think, and the escape of Chrisâ€™s eyes was full of confusion, suggesting that he had spent the rest of his life. Will live in emptiness, self-blame and remorse. The poor boy climbed up with his lover, reminiscent of &quot;Red and Black&quot;, but Chris had more than enough to engage in an affair; even hurt two lives, reminiscent of &quot;crime and punishment&quot; (even Chris in the film) Reading the book&#39;s shot, he should have been inspired by the book), but Chris seems to get rid of the punishment, but also lost the opportunity of redemption; there are people who put the story of &quot;being lover trying to destroy the mouth&quot; before the director The work &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; is compared because both explore propositions such as justice, destiny, and loyalty. In any case, the theme of this film is nothing more than the choice of greed and sensuality (speaking well is career and love?), the impact of luck on life. Chris is not a big sin, Chris is you and me. If you are not confident that you have such a dog, don&#39;t play with fire. A misstep is a thousand years of hatred, even if you can escape the legal sanctions, but the doubts about the future and the collapse of values â€‹â€‹will be doomed to tragic life. The title comes from the opening metaphor: When a game enters the match point, a ball hits the net and bounces. At this point, if it falls forward, it wins, and then it fails, and it depends on luck. The scene behind Chris throwing the ring echoed the beginning, but the director of the beggar reversed the ending: the ring was not thrown into the river, which originally indicated that the crime was exposed; but the ring was picked up by another group of criminals, but it was sinned for him. This highlights a major theme of the film?? Fate is impermanent.

Even though SNL is full of modern The funny bridge, the characters imitated and created by Bill are full of modern joy, as the screenwriter of South Park is also keeping up with the trend of the times, and returning to the self, perhaps like the hangover to the pool that I donâ€™t know today. Like a manager, he lives in a small world of self. As a deep movie house, he admires many classic films. In his top list, there are both Kurosawa and American youth films. After watching so many, he How would you evaluate his wifeâ€™s final To Do List? Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be applauding with my left eye and then screaming at my poor performance. Iâ€™m going to say about youth, sex, and high school students. Itâ€™s already ruined. Like â€œAmerican Pieâ€, â€œAmerican Style Paintingâ€, â€œYoung Frenzyâ€, etc., even horror movies like â€œScreamingâ€ Wearing American-style youth. So the appearance of To Do List is really boring at first glance, although the lineup of the Kass is extremely powerful, but many people have lost to the woman who is really accepting in the first ten minutes. However, it is only interesting to have such a female lord image. It is not to say that women&#39;s rights, women&#39;s rights have to find such people to advertise.

Look at the men in the film, although each is a comedy comedy, but It seems that each of them is quite Luther. Brandy Dad, whether you are a Shield or a dignified father, is actually a weak boy who is cared for by his mother.Efforts to flaunt their own authoritative image, but because their first time and their wife were not equal for the first time and were concealed for many years, the mother-in-law was sad for a long time, and the final good solution was taken outside by Brandyâ€™s mother. The second car shock can be comforted. Muscular man, looking at the countless women, knowing how to sell meat, playing tricks to bully the little girl, met Brandy&#39;s small strength and immediately became fascinated, and finally the combination with Brandy is just a battle of the gun (really Fast enough), and finally I was busy crying out to explain my traditional position. The one who contacted Brandy with KY, even the male initiative did not show up. Rock and roll, isn&#39;t that brain damage plus 2B? The male role that barely counts as a positive score is probably the pool manager and the little boyfriend. The role of the manager should be Maggie&#39;s inner image collection for Bill?é‚‹é¢, casual, happy, caught the opportunity to go up, calm down? ... This is a bit like Brandy, the role of the impression gradually divided from negative points. And the little boyfriend, also a nerd, and Brandy is a perfect match, all from scratch, and gradually grow up, in fact, this product is Brandy her dad! Either we will eventually find our father or mother-like person to do the other half, always feels very reasonable... (See How I Met Your Mother) Recalling the scene of Brandy her dad and her boyfriend crying, I want to come to many times. It really hates men like this animal. In fact, the so-called feminist rights are somewhat excessive, because after all, the physiological differences between men and women are very large, and it is unrealistic to insist on equality in many cases. But in fact, the psychological narrowness and weakness of men are really people who have to sweat. You see, a zero-experienced female schoolmaster relies on instinctual learning ability to pull out the man&#39;s fig leaf by list therapy. Here is a scene that needs brain supplementation. Brandy wears big glasses, holds the list in his hand, and pulls away the fig leaf, and does not judge much. He checks the mark on the book and leaves, leaving these bears. They were stunned and handcuffed and covered in red. I feel that this is the best place to watch this film. In terms of acting, you donâ€™t like it, the female star is very good here, and other female characters are also very good. Other male characters are somewhat off-line. The most inaccurate is Bill! I actually annoyed about feminism.However, it is really unpleasant to spit on the men. Maggie, what do you say?",movie

836,"This year&#39;s TV series &quot;Hanzawa Naoki&quot; broadcast at the TBS Theater in Japan became the focus of the century. A group of middle-aged uncles who created an average audience rating of 30%. The story is mainly about the bank employee who entered the central bank of Tokyo during the bubble economy. When he entered the banking industry, he faced colleagues, and he was born in the same period. He has to fight his enemies inside and outside the bank and realize his dreams. From the branch&#39;s financing class, step by step to the head office of the head office, and the process of last year&#39;s hit drama &quot;ç”„ä¼ ä¼ &quot;, the process from the bottom to the top is exactly the same. Game theory, Gong Xinji, abdominal black science are all used. In the early years, the Japanese felt confused about the work of the company as a life. When the Japanese economy was in a big shock, some employees were laid off, but in the morning they still smiled and took the tie from the wife and pretended to go to work. They actually went around to go to work, and when they paid the salary at the end of the month. It is really because of too much despair and suicide... In the epiphany, the Japanese must work hard with a very cherished mentality. Because work is not only the foundation for self-realization, but also a proof of the responsibility of family. Losing work simply means losing decent? No, it is a family responsibility that cannot be fulfilled. What did you say about the father of Azawa and the half? My father felt that working in a company is not just about completing his own tasks in a cold, but saying: &quot;Listen to the straight tree, what work can you do, you must cherish the interaction between people, but don&#39;t do robots. The same work.&quot; This philosophy makes the half-heartedness of the family and work responsibilities full of warmth and softness, believing that people are good. In the play, Bansawa often sighed with sorrow and grief after the crisis and stagnation in the workplace: &quot;Tooth again, double return&quot;. Can play the role of Banze? The Ya people said to the reporter interviewed in the audience: I really want to encounter such a situation, I may have a smile, still work well. Uncle Yaâ€™s words broke the reality. In the play, he dared to face the dignitaries, smashed the thorns, crossed the thousand obstacles and finally reached the goal. Comparing reality, ideals are ideals after all, with a personal heroism. If you can change through your own abilities, it is good to achieve through your own dreams. But if it is difficult to change, then it may be another kind of success as long as it has not been changed without being compromised. peopleIn the rivers and lakes, if you are involuntarily, if you are from the heart, stick to justice and faith, even if the wind comes in the rain, you will feel at ease. Success in the workplace is bound to be the contribution of teamwork, and multi-person cooperation is always more than one person alone. Half-time and the small partners in the same department, each other in the encounter, adapt to each other, but in the half-time decision-making moments of life, teammates will never give up, fight side by side, unite as one. Coffee and bread have become the medium for men to express their feelings. This is strength, determination, encouragement, and comfort. The subordinates of Banzer once said to him because of suspicion: &quot;The superiors of the subordinates are led, and the mistakes of the superiors are to be borne by the subordinates.&quot; But Nanze said: Even so, I am not willing to be such a person. To gain trust with real actions, to change hearts with the heart, to have a sense of righteousness, is a weapon that is unfavorable. As a result, after the success of the semi-azawa, he did not forget his initial heart, and he was grateful to let all those who had helped him get a spring report. In the workplace, I have a close colleague who can find very useful information. Therefore, Banzer often checks and uses information on the basis of collecting information. Bansawa is good at listening, and one part of the obedient content has not escaped his ears. At the crucial moment, his fear and high execution force have tripped over the deliberately set by others, and easily reveals what others have dug for him. pit. If you donâ€™t have a lot of words, you canâ€™t export them. In the face of martyrdom and bullying, Izumi has never used his impulses and sorrows to sneak into the air. He can forbear the ignorance of the principle that &quot;the man has gold under his knees&quot; crying for greater success in the future. The so-called big events, those with high visions, must first be those who can control their own emotions and have the ability to forbear. But in the end, the most iron-clad piece is: Banzer is proficient in his own business and knows his work well. If there is no such thing, the rest is also no good. It was burned up halfway this summer. He did not just endure the offenders, but counterattacked at the right time. I have to reflect on myself: Is there a relationship between people and people like him? Have I learned to listen carefully? What can I do to make a sincere and reliable partner? Others turn to me, can I help him with his best business knowledge? How to improve the execution of your goals and dreams?",movie

838,"Under the narrative line of Marvel Films, after the peacekeeping wars of the nine major countries, the domain of God (why not become such an elegant and elegant name as Asgard) is greatly hurt, reflected in the appearance, the former episode of golden light, Itâ€™s dazzling, and itâ€™s a temple that is inhabited by higher races. Itâ€™s dark and gloomy. Itâ€™s like black lacquered black, and the interior is like a medieval bunker, like a cheap community with poor lighting. Even Rainbow Bridge is not amazing. The only brightest thing is the cell where Loki stays. The layout of the room is very similar to the high-tech detention center of SHIELD. It is set with a circle of flowing Phnom Penh, so that the Luogongzi who is trapped in it has a special aristocratic style. Along with the spread of the dead in the gods, the solemn and solemn solemnity of the first episode of Shakespeareâ€™s courts disappeared, and the whole tone was frivolous and irritable. The Great Odin also suffered from a physical and mental trauma, becoming weak, aggressive, stubborn, short-sighted, and more eager than the young Raytheon, and could not see the wisdom, the city, and the strategy of the king. Although the speed of the dialogue is much faster than that of the previous episode, in many scenes, there is a feeling that the slow half-beat is dragged away, and the inferior position is still in control of the overall situation, once angered. Domineering is more vain, and there is no way to live. In the last episode, you will feel that you should not provoke this old man. This time, you will speculate that this old man is a soft persimmon in the domain of God. It is best to attack him first. For the third time, Rocky grabbed the thunder of the thunder on the screen. The demon charmed the more humorous, more deceitful, more fickle and speculative, and Sol was still the chest muscle that would only fight and leave the woman. Male, the mouth is always lost, and the judge is judged. Some friends are very dissatisfied with Loki&#39;s &quot;become better and worse&quot;. In fact, in the opinion of the author, Rocky&#39;s corner is the same as Captain Jack of Pirates of the Caribbean. It is an opportunistic supremacist, a risky madman, and extremely good at The chaotic dragon that hides the intention, betrayed and sold, sees the wind, turns the rudder, and the virtual and the snake is just his style of work. Just like Raytheon can&#39;t be tempted with a big hammer, it can&#39;t be included in moral judgment, and it doesn&#39;t matter if it gets better or worse. In the middle section, his salvation, I prefer to be from the heart, not pure deception, just like the captain of the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 returning to fight the octopus, the Asgard has the same glory and piracy. Knight style. Throughout the three films, Loki did not harm the unarmed innocents. He even abused his brother, and how much can be explained. This film is the first TV drama director Alan TaylorThe second shot of the production of science fiction film, its screen representative is &quot;the game of rights.&quot; Tai Teng has not been involved in the big screen for a long time, and the TV tricks have been moved in full. &quot;Game of Rights&quot; is a Class A TV show, but if you put a big screen, it is only a B-level work. The family stared at the TV in the brightly lit living room (and had to insert advertisements from time to time), and hundreds of people indulged in the dark space on the big screen, the means of stimulating the senses can be very different. The Thai guide has manipulated the drama or the American drama. It is too restrained and stable. It has not fully mobilized the emotional fluctuations of the waves. It relies on the ups and downs of the story itself. It is regrettable that he hopes that his &quot;Terminator 5&quot; will not be so constrained. . There are also TV drama features in the play. In addition to Stan Lee&#39;s grandfather, there are as many as seven screenwriters, three of which have American TV backgrounds. It&#39;s no wonder. Parallel editing of the &quot;explanation plan&quot; and &quot;execution plan&quot; that escaped from the domain of God was so astounding in the use of American drama. With regard to the richness of Lokki&#39;s life and death, there are seven or eight kinds of speculations about the truth and subsequent development. Even a series of movies rarely do so. Only TV dramas with ratings are life-like. There are some very strange dialogues in the film, such as the date and space of the table appointment and the moment of kissing, very funny, but it does not match the temperament of the movie, it will be very good in the soap opera. The art direction is remarkable. You can find the film from The Body of Iron, Star Wars, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator, Mad Max, and any big-production medieval movie. Shadow, the original power is certainly weak, so that under the huge investment, there is a very cinematic visual presentation, which enhances the sense of presence of the blockbuster. Another worthy acknowledgment is the effort to bring the two worlds closer together. The Earth occupies an important position in the plan of the dark forces, and Miss Jane is obsessed with interpreting the oracle medical device as a quantum position generator (like this name). ), the righteous and evil forces have jointly contributed to the harmonious coexistence and common development of the Divine and the Earth, and for more stories can be played on the Earth.",movie
839,"Almost all recent reports and comments on The Age of Innocence have been said. Five years ago, this TV series was filmed and warned. Because the story involved sensitive topics, it has not been reviewed by the SARFT until recently. After reading 38 episodes in one breath, after reading it, my heart is also mixed with feelings. Although most of the dramas in the TV series have not been experienced by myself, it is these very real and sincere things that can resonate with people&#39;s emotions. In recent years, there have been many dramas in successive appearances of David, and these nostalgic film and television works such as &quot;Wind and Sun&quot; and &quot;Educated Youth&quot; have received rave reviews, and &quot;Innocent Age&quot; as a reform and opening up The panoramic review and outlook of the history of the paragraph is more refined and more touching. The main line of the story is to follow the whole process of reform and opening up, from the intellectual youth of the Cultural Revolution to the countryside, to the resumption of the college entrance examination, to the reform and opening up, the establishment of the market economic system, the shareholding reform of state-owned enterprises, SARS, which belong to the collective memory of a generation. The marked events turned into a real story, and they were staged one by one in a group of educated youths who became the tides of the reform and opening up. Looking at the whole work, I feel that the value of this drama lies in reflecting on the micro-impact caused by the great policy of reform and opening up, which is decisive for China&#39;s development, through the ups and downs of individual destiny. At the same time, through the retrospection of this historical front, the most realistic state of humanity in the face of temptation in the face of interest is restored. Everyone in this TV series is an ordinary person. Compared with this big background, it is simply a dust that cannot be seen by the naked eye. During the Cultural Revolution, they were sent to the countryside to receive training. Because of the policy reasons, they saved their great youth in the countryside. Only after the resumption of the college entrance examination system can they achieve the turning point of fate. Facing the wave of reform and opening up, facing the complicated interests. Relationships, they are difficult to adapt to the great development of society because of policy changes; in the face of the temptation of money and interests, they have to sacrifice the friendship of friends who have worked hard for many years. They are the most authentic beings of that era, the witnesses of all the changes of that era, and the victims of all the dark sides of that era. The small characters also have their own joys and sorrows and clutches. It is the emotional journey of the little characters that reflects the changes in society. Li Jiaxuan and Yan Guangwei, the brothers of the suffering, have lived the test of women, but because ofIn order to separate the disputes for the interests, he finally ended up with the tragedy of Jing Guangweiâ€™s life-saving district; Li Jiaxuan and Jing Jing were in love with each other in Paradise, and after 30 years of change, they finally walked together. The educated youths who went to the countryside together in the past, in the history of reform and opening up, struggled and intrigued, and tried hard to get rid of their personal appearances. In the end, they basically lost both sides. While reform and opening up have brought us enormous material wealth, what impact do microcosmic people have on their emotions and their lives? This TV series is probably a good answer. District Jing said a paragraph inside, which means profoundly: &quot;In the end, after the reform and opening up, our days are much better than before. How can we think about leaving property for future generations?&quot; Ideas. But now is different, money can be earned from generation to generation.&quot; &quot;In the end, I have to thank Grandpa Deng.&quot; This is also a relatively pertinent evaluation of a certain aspect of reform and opening up. Count it, this year is 13 years, pushing forward for 5 years, just in 2008, the 30th anniversary of reform and opening up. The other name of the play is &quot;Our Thirty Years&quot;, which is obviously the 30th anniversary of the reform and opening up. However, I did not expect that a ban would be five years. Imagine that this film can be reviewed by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. To a large extent, reform and opening up is not a sensitive and taboo topic. Its merits and demerits can be discussed. And its positive evaluation of its role in social development will also be of great significance to future reform and development. From the work itself, there are basically no handsome men and women in the actors, but the acting is very solid and very infectious. They are like people of that era, and many details are done in place, giving the atmosphere that the era should have. They are all very well created. In the last episode, in the SARS isolation ward, A Jing and Zhao Yuhong began to recall the past events of the educated youth era. At that time, Zhao Shuji, who was flying and arrogant, became a middle-aged woman who was sitting in a hospital bed and squinted at one eye. She regretted that she did not cherish the stupid man who gave up her life and arranged her own tears. Suddenly, I felt particularly emotional. Their own little stories have formed a magnificent history, a time of turmoil.",movie

It is expected that the superheroes will be able to bring some surprises to the audience. However, it seems that the expectations are too high. The film almost completely degenerates into an advertisement for the promotion of superheroes. It is actually a matter of joining the dogma of family ethics. The directorâ€™s attempt to enrich the characterâ€™s heart and make the character seem contradictory is obviously out of place in this film. Just a superhero movie likes to dig into the heart of the character, even at the expense of turning it into a historical counter-revolution to highlight the current resurgence of re-enactment.

In fact, the mastermind behind the scenes is the property owner who rents the venue to perform for the magician!

Do you know how many DVDs I sold during this period? 5 million!â€ Suppose I buy the old Friedman DVD. One-third of the people could have been attracted to the live magic show, so it can be said that Old Friedman destroyed more than half of the box office in the live performance industry. Do you understand? Old Friedman symbolizes the deadly threat of the new media to the old media that used to make money at the box office of the live magic show! Of course, it is also a &quot;traitor&quot; in the magician industry. In order to rectify this phenomenon, and at the same time save or even reactivate the vitality of the industry, a number of theaters jointly formed the action, and the so-called eye is nothing more than a bluff of their classics.

He is cool enough to be cool enough for Shen Xiaole&#39;s unrequited love, but the uncle is tender and always feels the shortcomings. In the second half, Chen Yudao made his own experience of acquaintance, and was mistakenly recognized as Shen Xiaole, who was so desperate enough to be desperate enough to have a leg with Wang Baijie. Wang Bojie suddenly came out to spoil the situation, but also cheated Zhang Hanyu&#39;s company, and finally gave up, there is always a sudden and taken for granted. In addition, Sun Xing is still playing with the beautiful woman, playing the playboy, and still has a point. Of course, &quot;I love&quot; can be seen everywhere, but also make it a dark horse.

At least I didnâ€™t laugh. .... When a joke can&#39;t make people laugh, it&#39;s a joke. If a comedy can&#39;t make people laugh, it&#39;s a cold drama.",movie

I feel that the plot has a lot of similar content, but this film is more profound, more realistic, and more in line with the temperament of the Hong Kong film, but the super broker is telling the truth is really messy. This film not only has its ups and downs, but also depicts the parts of the relationship. The whole film has his recommended parts. I feel that it is very touching to get people&#39;s minds up and down. In fact, the male master is quite unsuccessful, but he will wake up. It is not a bad thing to have a loss. This is something that everyone must pass, and overall it is still very inspirational.",movie

More than an hour, Nima astronauts in the universe are really no ps traces. How time has passed for the past 30 years, but the effects have been lower than the Terminator&#39;s era?

For example, she said that the monthly deposit of 180,000 is the middle and upper family.

852,"I went to see it with a recently known blind date. After reading the other party, it means that only the front is interesting, there is nothing to laugh behind. Maybe because he is the first blind date, maybe he is a man. Therefore, the vocabulary of the leftover man and the woman are not like my many relatives. I am going to change from the &quot;primary leftover woman&quot; to the &quot;intermediate leftover woman&quot;. It may be a bit blunt to say that the three female lords in the movie actually have a few points like me. I have such a hot and stupid heart. At the same time, like Mi Xue, I listened to my parentsâ€™ words from a young age. In fact, the quiet appearance is actually a house and a rot. After work, it is like a white crystal, so strong and strong, pursuing perfection, like to use Work to pass the time, unconsciously has become a workaholic in the eyes of others. So I don&#39;t even know what kind of men to choose. The picky one did not like the choice of the three female owners. The first is the best man. Du Haitaoâ€™s voice in this area is even smaller than his eyes, the typical southern little man. In the end, I was fascinated by him. It was also a prelude to writing the script, and it was a college student. The concept of loving small and cheap money can be understood by her. I have seen the first time I met and went to the coffee shop but only ordered two fried rice, and I only invited KFC Coke, and I didnâ€™t even eat it. I only went to the campus to go to the lake to blow the cold wind. Sorry, I can only give you NO. A blind date is indeed a venture capital, but is there a minimum respect for women? Saving money is to give yourself a future wife-in-law. You have already been out of this idea when you have this idea, because you think that you will not spend the rest of your life with her, so you will not spend money for her. What is it with you?

Let me say that the otaku who is programming does not wear glasses! Unscientific, not scientific! At first I really wanted to find a technology house, and I like animation games and electronic products as much as I do. Later, I found that the otaku is generally not self-reliant, and there is no such thing as a man. I have seen the temperament of the conversation is very weak, and I have to ask for a road to let me go forward, and even every time I meet the seven aunts and eight aunts to follow. Sorry, I still have to give you NO. oldThe husband, the lady is looking for an attack, not to find a good one. Men look down on their homes, want to let women come? Then you still have to be a million years old, find a man BL to go.

In the end, because Zhang Wei helped her work problems, she won the light, and Zhang Wei was originally the heir to the chairman. This finally decided to associate with Zhang Wei. Jingjing, after she was 22 years old, experienced a love affair that she thought she would die, she still did not die. Just become more indifferent.

Zhang Wei chased her initial heart is just &quot;this woman is indifferent but has a bit of beauty, I want to conquer her&quot; such frivolous thoughts, maybe someday tired of putting Jingjing aside. Jingjing knows this very well. Therefore, she does not pursue romance and material. After the end of love, she will not get anything, but pursue her own improvement and make herself better. Even if love is over, she still has a career she loves. Love is nothing but a prop in her hand. Maybe when I get to the age of Bai Jingjing and evolve into a &quot;high-end left woman,&quot; I will understand her mood more deeply. I have seen too many people, but I donâ€™t know what I want.

855,"If I didn&#39;t guess wrong, the behind-the-scenes screenwriter of the movie &quot;Unexpected Love Time&quot; should be a little girl from the South. The vast majority of the bridges in this film are full of tastes of southerners. In many places, I have seen this handsome northern guy, and I always feel boring. Why is the screenwriter a little girl? Because only the little girl will be obsessed with the world of her love, writing some paragraphs that are not marginal. In a word, look at this movie, you need at least the level of your IQ and emotional intelligence to be less than twenty girls. Of course, this girl must not be a Northeast female, she must come from Taiwan, Fujian. A band. From the perspective of the script, this is a work that is still a certain distance from the passing standard. You can even suspect that the writer is a literary dream or a relative of a Dove chocolate CEO who has had a literary dream of addiction. The advancement of all the bridge sections is disorderly and disorderly. The manufacture of any laughter point is nothing to laugh at, and the lines are set to stay at the level of the middle school test composition. The rhythm of the whole story is confusing, and the so-called climax of no film art can be said, all the way straight and plain, unremarkable, and ultimately lead to the film is boring. The director has also done a lot of work, especially in the selection of scenes and scenery. This unsigned natural scenic area is full of points for the film. However, because of the powerlessness of a play, it can only cause &quot;Unexpected Love Time&quot; to be an extended version of Dove Chocolate. Looking at advertisements, it is necessary to give money to the audience. However, the big advertisements of the ministry have been labeled with dragons to &quot;cheat&quot; the audience. Although the director is hard, it is inevitable that he will be desecrated. Guo Caijie carries the temperament of a young girl in the South. There is nothing wrong with it. Although the individual does not like this kind of chick, it seems to be recognized as a type of film character. Of course, personally think that Guo Caijie is not beautiful enough, and even ugly, the performance in the play is excellent. On the contrary, it is suppressed by the wonderful acting of girlfriends. Shooting advertisements and taking PPTs may be a distance from the film. In this drama, Guo Caijie is not much better than the performance in &quot;Little Times&quot;, and even suspected of regression. Fang Zuming is the focus of my article. His performance in the film is still a silly look in movies such as &quot;The Adventures of Li Xianji&quot; and &quot;A City&quot;. Although there is a saying that is hard to hear, it just happens to describe the role of Fang Zuming&#39;s role. It is a half-odd and silly child born by his father. Fang Zuming does have a mighty father. He is called Jackie Chan. Jackie Chan,The inside of the film circle (juan) is called his eldest brother. The old actor who has worked hard for decades in the film circle is rich in social resources that can be mobilized. The son Fang Zuming wants to take the film actor&#39;s path, and his father naturally helps. There are rumors in the rumors that the search for Fang Zumingâ€™s filming is to give Jackie Chan a relationship. Some of the crews once came out. Fang Zuming called a phone call to Jackie Chan. He said that the crew lacked the missing one. Jackie Chanâ€™s old man sent a shortage of technicians the next day. For the son&#39;s play, Jackie Chan has always been short of money to give money, and lack of people to give. In the context of such a rich local tyrant, why has Fangâ€™s name been a bad character? Any movie starring Fang Zuming is a model of bad film. As long as readers have carefully watched all the movies in the room, they will think that this sentence is not an exaggeration. With such a local background, I have the ability to pick and choose on the script selection. He is not like Yang Mi, there is a complicated brokerage company behind the scenes, and it is necessary to guarantee the output every year. Fang Zuming has full capital to choose. Why didnâ€™t he choose? This may be related to the inherent mode of thinking of Hong Kong actors. The vast majority of actors in Hong Kong rely on quantitative improvement to achieve the final qualitative improvement. Jackie Chan also maintained a strong number of shootings in his early years, and he practiced himself in the vast majority of bad films. Fang Zuming does not pick the script, whoever looks for the show, it is really necessary to return to the life of the actors in Hong Kong&#39;s early years, to gain experience in countless filming. Since there is such a local tyrant, his chances are naturally great. It is not necessary to cherish any opportunity to appear on the mirror, as in the case of ordinary background actors. Of course, in doing so, Fang Zuming can gain experience, but in the current era of fast food culture, there are not many opportunities left for Fang Zuming. You have been a bad film, and your box office value is going to become negative. Recently, there have been many reports. The female has Cecilia Cheung and the male has the name of the ancestors. They are all box office poisons. Once the hat of the box office poison is implemented, even if the local tyrants have the ability to do so again, they may be weak. After reading the article, I want to see the author, listen to the hoarse voice, watch the old horse talking about the woman, you can poke the video below:",movie

Alan Taylor playing ice fire is more than the play of Kenneth Brana will grasp the rhythm and mood of geek movies, compared to the rush of the last episode, the quality of this episode is superb, the attitude of awkwardness is gone, The taste of the rigid stage disappeared completely. The Wonder that I felt in the panoramic view of Asgard was no worse than the Victoria Harbour in this summer. I really donâ€™t feel anything about Hammer, but I still feel that my beloved Shakespeare is too few. Although it has already burst into a blast, itâ€™s said that Marvelâ€™s development of Lokiâ€™s role will come to an end.

The second stage finale is the next year&#39;s US team 2, so this piece is the same as the steel 3 except for the silver-protected egg and the uncle&#39;s big killer.

At first glance, it was all the natural snow scenes of mountains and jungles, with an overwhelming momentum and a peaceful scene in the lens. It is in the same vein as the silence in the town streets. However, in such a quiet mood, there is a long and lingering, warm and romantic bitter love between two men and a woman. Of course, this is not the kind of love triangle in the ordinary urban love drama, but a very touching and great love story of each other, and you can linger in the purity and beauty of love. The story of &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; is not only simple, but also not tortuous. Its simple style is not only boring but rather intriguing, because there is a narrative structure of Sakamoto Satoshi&#39;s director, because there is a long history of music. Because of the photographic style of Ueno. In the film, Lin Zhiling plays the role of Lin Yue and the student in the pool, and the two eves of the ski resort ambulances, which are ten years of painful and unforgettable feelings, in the tangled details. Walk into our hearts little by little. Shinohara Sugawara repeatedly used the structure of recall and reality to exchange the story structure. Under the super-rich layer of soundtrack and picture editing, the inner and the inner actor&#39;s inner spurs were dissected layer by layer, and the audience walked one step at a time. Go to the inner world of the story protagonist to understand the cause and effect and feel the beauty of love. The protagonists step by step to open the knot and finally open their hearts to accept the reality and start a new warm life. This beautiful and romantic style, fresh and pure interpretation, let the audience and the protagonists experience the beautiful taste of love in the fairytale town of Xiazhang, which not only matches the taste of love, but also matches the chocolate. That taste... This is a very &quot;taste&quot; movie. The taste of the film is derived from chocolate and more than chocolate. The chocolate is completely and meticulously treated as a totem in this film. The meaning is irrelevant and is rendered, including enthusiasm, friendship, and especially love. In this love story, the color of the film is as bitter, delicate and sweet as chocolate. Between Lin Yue, Xing Ye Shou, Wood Field and Chocolate, the whole is a warm and inseparable warmth! As a warm and delicate love movie, there is no big ups and downs in this episode. Even if it is a plot of life and death, the film always maintains the pure and natural expression, which makes people feel hypnotic and silky.Silk falls asleep, but it can make people squat, it is very suitable for this kind of cold, no-heating autumn, with a kind of love to warm the heart and body. In &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot;, not only does the chocolate and the hero and heroine in the story have a variety of things, but the style and story of the whole film, as well as the interpretation and taste of love, will make you feel appreciated. Such a sweet movie of love movies, like the taste of your favorite chocolate, slowly melts at the tip of the tongue, the sweet taste reverberates in the mouth, the silky taste lingers for a long time... and we watch the movie.

859,"If you want to divide the Asian thriller from the type, there is nothing more than a room to escape, a chain of crimes, a ghost-ridden, a sly report, a strange animal, but when I am in the big sky, the ghosts and foxes canâ€™t talk more, so they can be released. Thrillers are also in the form of &quot;human scary&quot;. The risk of shooting thrillers is high, either left or right, or overdue, so this type of film is mostly at a small cost. Due to the limitations of the story and funds, it can&#39;t be fully developed. It can only do some boring &quot;suddenly scare you&quot; Shantou, to support the entire film, so the rotten film is mostly. A few days ago, I watched the thriller &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦&quot;, some meanings, there are accidents everywhere: First of all, this is not a bad film. In the era when the mainland horror film is almost synonymous with rotten film, it is very unexpected; secondly, the film title is &quot; Carpooling, in fact, the main body is a movie that escaped from the secret room. It is quite unexpected. Once again, the words &quot;to pay tribute to the worldâ€™s suspense master Hitchcock&quot; at the end of the film, let people suddenly realize that the film and The masterpieces &quot;Bird&quot;, &quot;The Soul&quot;, &quot;Doctor Edward&quot;, &quot;The Guest&quot;, etc. all have inextricable relationships, and indeed have ingenuity. However, I would like to comment on &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦è½¦&quot;, but it is very difficult to write, I am afraid that if I accidentally say the bottom of my riddle, I will directly erase the audience&#39;s perception and deprive the audience of the terrorist rights and the desire to guess. This is in the process of watching the movie, guessing more. The ending is eager to win the bid once. It may be completely different. Perhaps this is the charm of the thriller. Although it is the spectator of the authorities, the authorities do not want to be fascinated. It is also an indisputable fact that the onlookers do not want to be clear. In fact, the most fascinating thing is not the audience sitting in the movie theater. They are the characters in the film. Their judgment ability is often more powerful. Therefore, when judging a film with suspenseful colors, two important things. The criteria for judging are indispensable. One is whether or not they are scared. The second is whether the IQ of the characters in the film is higher than themselves? The horror that is led by the plot is the best choice. The foreign minister of &quot;Carpooling Car&quot; is especially like a horrible road film. After all, &quot;carpooling&quot; is going on the road, whether it is going back or not returning, but as we have seen, a person sitting on a variety of people, etc. The vans, who donâ€™t know each other, donâ€™t know any details, so they take a car injury. In the rainy night, they drive into the winding mountain road that is far and near, which is the rhythm of â€œdeathâ€, but itâ€™s also strange. Itâ€™s not blame, after all, even the love films are beginning to â€œmake upâ€. The men and women of the horror film go to â€œmadeâ€ and are also hit.set. Therefore, when a broken car is parked in front of a ghostly villa in the infinitely dark night, you should know that the dark phantom has begun to be a bloodthirsty celebration. At this point, the true face of the film story is all revealed, this is a scene of escape from the secret room. Recalling the carpooling and driving clips, just like many Hollywood thrillers, just summoning each other together to &quot;die&quot;, after all, the people are more subtle, not through such a mutually beneficial and small-cost ride It is very difficult to get together so many people. Look at people&#39;s Hollywood, always handsome men or college students or party to know, and soon call friends to drive on the road, or lakeside or big house or hotel to &quot;send to death&quot;, a lot of bold. However, if you think about coming back, in fact, the director arranges the story of a few strangers sitting in the same car. It is easier to explain through the lens and have a clearer understanding of several people. After all, all the cars are acquaintances, and they will be confused. Who is who, let alone expand to make everyone clear. The subsequent encounters of the pedestrians were also inseparable from the previous preparations. The film showed the passing of a few people from the car to the villa one day and one night, showing a few distinctive passers-by: a lascivious driver The enchanting lady, the lawyer outside the strong middle, the designer Xiaobai face, the outdoor woman who is strong and soft outside, the abandoned man who was abandoned... the car started, the car turned off, the rainy night rescued, the mountain stayed... Carpooling, spelling out the day and night of the strange wind and rain. Everyoneâ€™s story has been inadvertently and vividly unfolded. In addition to this ticket, and the male and female masters of the night house, the musician Becker, played by the poison tongue judge Bao Xiaobo, is undoubtedly a highlight of the film. Amazingly good performances must be praised. No accidents, no horror, this sentence is correct in the &quot;Carpooling&quot;.",movie
860,"Why do I like to watch an animated film? In fact, it is not just me. Many adults like to watch an animated film, of course, it is only a small proportion. Many people say that it is important to keep a child. Others said that the child&#39;s innocence has always been, but it has been unconsciously dusted. Animated movies may just meet this need. But it can only be like a drug, only to let you indulge in a moment, not the same is that you will not be difficult to give up. So, in general, I don&#39;t think I can find anything from life to real life or consciousness. Letting you laugh, it is enough. If you have such a demand, go to other classic movies. Although they are similar to drugs, the effect is stronger. If a hammer is knocked hard enough, it may wake up. Of course, the role played by an animated film may also be imperceptible. After reading so many animated films, I did not find out how many childlike hearts I have regained. This cannot be calculated and measured. Recently, Hayao Miyazakiâ€™s movie made me feel a little bit. When I look at it one by one, I donâ€™t really feel much. The style of each one is the same, so itâ€™s the same thing. Now, I have finished reading his classic animations. When I look back, I suddenly find that there is a strong feeling. It is the kind of feeling that 1+1+1+1+...+1=a lot, like a glass of water. Add a little sugar, take a sip, add a little sugar, and take another sip. Just keep adding, keep drinking, and you will find it getting sweeter. I think it should be a chronic &quot;poison.&quot; Look at other art forms, such as music, painting, and literary works. This kind of art is not like war. War is a strong agent, and the effect is fast, but the side effects are stronger. They slowly render the world, which is to see the obvious colors for decades or even centuries. There is no such talent, all for you, you can&#39;t accept it. So, don&#39;t go to the top of these art forms, close your eyes, and let them rain on your body like rain. How much is wet.",movie

Of course, this kind of plot can only be said to respect historical facts. . .

862,"Children watching animation sees an expectation of the future. The simple anthropomorphic line does not mean the expression of low IQ, but rather a deep way of understanding the world. Many adults say that they don&#39;t understand cartoons, not because animation is too complicated, but after they have been polished by life, the way to understand the world has become single, and there is no dream. On the acceptance level, rather than saying that we are going to watch an animated story, it is better to go to see art and creativity. The excitement brought by the sculpt of the day is far more than the ups and downs of the plot. There is no difference between a Hollywood cartoon and a live-action film on the narrative, just to show the human story in a non-human form. However, when we look at the visual blockbuster, it is often after the cool, one place, and a few words. But the treatment of cartoons is much better, and the audience is almost a good applause. This aspect is related to the characteristics of cuteness, joy, and innocence in the animation. Everyone can&#39;t resist these beautiful things. On the other hand, it is also related to the market trend of cartoons today. Traditional cartoons mainly face young audiences. Now the key words of cartoon production are â€œfamily and youngâ€, and only then can there be better box office guarantee. This is the case with &quot;The Elf Hostel&quot;. This story about the father&#39;s attitude towards his daughter&#39;s education is in line with the connotation of the current reality show &quot;Where is Dad?&quot; Father Dracula is the protagonist of this story. At the same time, talent is the main audience of this animation. At the beginning of the film, the dialogue between Dracula and her daughter Memphis was used to explain the conflicts of this film. Whether to &quot;capture&quot; or &quot;stock&quot; the children. Then, a large group of monsters came to the Elf Hotel and prepared to give Mephis a birthday. The geeks, transparent people, werewolves, mummies, invisible people, etc., are large or small or ugly or beautiful or crazy or sinuous, and they are dazzling and dim, reflecting the creator&#39;s talent and imagination. Just by the scene of this monster, the film has created a prestige and mobilized everyone&#39;s interest in watching movies. According to the classic narrative routine, when the film is half an hour later, there will be a â€œlove nodeâ€ that changes the direction of the story and the goals of the characters for further development. In &quot;The Elf Hotel&quot;, Jonathan, the traveler, suddenly appeared. He broke into the monster hotel that avoided humanity because he lost his way, which brought great trouble to Dracula. Dracula didn&#39;t want her daughter to see humans, but her daughter met Jonathan and saw the clock.situation. &quot;Which pot does not open the pot,&quot; things that don&#39;t want to happen will happen. This is a common way of creating tension in movies, and it is also a dilemma that fate often experiences. The development of love must go through hardships, otherwise it will appear cheap. When Jonathan and Mephis had watched the sunrise and the two hearts on the roof together, Jonathanâ€™s human identity was exposed, causing a panic of the monster, and he had to leave. But this is only the darkness before dawn, don&#39;t worry too much. Dracula realized from his daughter&#39;s sadness that his teachings were wrong. Compared with safety, happiness is the most important thing. He decided to pursue Jonathan. The film is once again playing with the drama skills, allowing Dracula to complete the mission in a limited time, and finally successfully intercepted the Jonathan plane. The story reaches its climax, just like all the big movies, this plot must be carried out in the air, because it seems to be high-end atmosphere. &quot;The Elf Hotel&quot; is the reverse of the plot and the character of the character, in order to suppress the story, not only realizes the dramatic expression of the story, but also solves the moral problem of the transmission of good and evil. The little friends will not be taught badly, and the adults will not worry that their children will be taught bad. This model is the same as &quot;Despicable Me&quot;. But the final turn of the film was too impetuous. With Draculaâ€™s honest admittance, the monsters changed their attitudes and decided to help him recover Jonathan. The handling of this place lacks buffering. It should be entangled for a while, and then landing, there will be no friction. Compared with the previous &quot;Crazy Primitives&quot;, the two films are similar in expressing their parents&#39; love and the young people&#39;s yearning for the outside world. However, there are many plots in the &quot;Original&quot; that are based on the ancients. The pop culture also has a good mockery, such as taking pictures with a slate ipad, it is very cola. &quot;The Elf Hotel&quot; has done a poor job in terms of comedy effects. Although it has added a lot of musical elements to make the scene look very lively, there are few places where people laugh and laugh.",movie
863,"Personally, the film is called &quot;The Beautiful Boy on Lido Island&quot;. The beauty of the teenager, so that for the first time through the perspective of the man, I saw a girl. It was not until the sound came out that I realized that this was a teenager. Seeing 90 minutes, I am still imagining what the first time a man and a teenager will talk to each other. The result is not to the end of the drama. The peep of the man, we can understand the angle of appreciation of a beautiful art. In the elevator, the first close contact, it is really unreasonable to guess whether the male lower body reacted. What I also don&#39;t understand is the reaction of the boy to the man. A few times, I turned around, looked at me, and put on a pose. Isnâ€™t this intentional seduce? More than once, I imagined: The teenager found the man peeping, and would come boldly, simply asking: Why have you been watching me? I can&#39;t imagine how the man will answer. The plot of the movie was rather vague, and it was thought that the man was dead on the street. I was lying in bed and dreaming. Is the man and the play &quot;Alice in Alice&quot; a real drama? Is it to say that the man has a call for action. Playing a man, near the next mouth, missing a few teeth, I am very strange: just like this, can sing, no teeth are not full of mouths running? The man is going to the hairdressing and beauty salon. You dyed a black hair and who did you wear a hat? I also smeared my lips and wiped my face. As a result, the black dye was mixed with sweat to make a big face.",movie
864,"&quot;Nuosangjue Temple&quot; is actually the first novel completed by Jane Austen. The manuscript, also called Susan, was sold to booksellers at a price of Â£10, but there was never a chance to publish; until the other four novels of Jane were published (pseudonym), the copyright of the novel was at the same price. Buy it yourself. Jane immediately modified it, including changing the name of the protagonist from Susan to Catherine. Soon, the 41-year-old Jane died of illness. Her brother and essay agent, Henry, named the book &quot;Nuo Sangjue Temple&quot; and published it together with Jane&#39;s last novel, Persuasion. &quot;Nuosanjue Temple&quot; is considered to be the most relaxed and humorous of Jane Austen&#39;s six novels. Although the theme is nothing more than a manifestation of marriage, status, wealth, love conflicts, and the heroine&#39;s growth and awakening, but this time joined the parody of the popular Gothic novels at the time, and that looks gloomy and mysterious The Nosangjue Castle adds suspense and fun to the story. The film also does a good job of visualizing Catherine&#39;s fantasy and dreams in a way that makes it slightly different from other fresh British pieces. The film is part of the Jane Austen Season launched by the British Independent Television (ITV) in the spring of 2007. The other two books together were Mansfield Manor and Persuasion. Because of the limited budget, all cast members have basically no big names, but the production level is still guaranteed. Later, the redder was playing Carey Mulligan of Isabella, who had a different heart. Two years later, she once again appeared in &quot;Growth Education&quot; as a girl who was tempted by a mature man and was nominated for an Oscar-winning film.",movie
865,"When it comes to domestic thrillers, I believe that most people don&#39;t take it for granted. In the era of rapid recovery of the film market, many movies have been lauded with golden keys, and they have been given various missions or meanings, or collective memories. International honors, or promote what reveals what, or develop market research and development technology, high-end film is busy, the thriller is like a bear child who does not hurt, do not love, almost every time you enter the market will be dog blood Showering the streets to show the crowd. Is this prejudice? Is this sin deserved? The author is not convinced that these works, which are also full of the creators&#39; efforts and talents, can only be apprehensively applauded from the newly released &quot;Rhyme Carpool&quot; to the domestic thriller. Tension director&#39;s &quot;Carpooling&quot; has been released since the 8th, and the fans&#39; comments on Time Online have reached 7.5 points. Currently, it is 6.9 points. Many fans and film critics have given their opinions or goodwill opinions through the Internet. It is rare in domestic films. It is rare for domestic thrillers. What makes &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦&quot; a counterattack in the type of bear to the bottom? In fact, the answer is very simple. Everything comes from the quality of the film itself, solid stories, full emotions, and precise film language. The story of the film itself is as sturdy as a tightrope, half of which is a road crash, half of which is a series of murders in a blizzard, and the characters are like the jumping notes in space, and the chords are full of rhythm and strength. A group of rushing people carpooled to the suburbs, anchored in the night rain, had to borrow a pianist&#39;s villa, a widow who died of a mountaineering accident after a divorce, a sexy vulgar prostitute, a greedy driver, one A slightly deviant young painter, a arrogant female lawyer, a scarred uninvited guest, plus a pianist in the villa, Becker and his wife, Jiao Jiao, the film used these eight characters in a small space. The identity background and personality traits are clearly clarified, and there is a difference between heaven and earth compared to those films that only accumulate bizarre events and have no character. Cars, highways, gas stations, toilets, villas, bathrooms, &quot;Carpooling&quot; is a good use of these closed spaces to create an atmosphere, while spare no effort to make people live in it, BYK&#39;s attachment, Wang Siyao&#39;s demons are fully Rendering, the actions and encounters of other characters are also based on their respective personalities, and each plot is supported by abundant rationality. Pianos, wheelchairs and other props also played a key role in the final puzzle process, not simply props, these fineThe festival fully illustrates the rigor of the creator. In fact, the word-of-mouth dilemma of the thriller is not unique to China. Looking at the world, every year, Hitchcock has not seen the brand effect that can lead the trend for decades. The director of tension is deliberately naming the domestic thriller, paying tribute to the master with crow elements and bathroom plots, and building a story of love and hate, life and death around the shaping of the characters, so that the audience can enjoy a cold sweat, but also Enjoy a wonderful story. Therefore, it has become the best domestic thriller in 2013, and it has been a good example for the domestic counterparts. In the face of the strong reputation of &quot;Shu car&quot;, compared with its box office results, it is thought-provoking. The domestic thriller is not lacking in the market. In the impression, &quot;Crysis&quot;, &quot;Embroidered Shoes&quot; and even the &quot;Midnight Taxi&quot; stream are sold. Itâ€™s full of pots and overflows, and itâ€™s a sudden rise in the nickname of the tide, but now, the reputation of â€œRhyme Carpoolâ€ is facing a box office dilemma. The film is a masterpiece, and the theme of &quot;Crazy for Love&quot; is quite close to the current Singles Day, but it has not achieved the results it deserves. From all indications, there is a problem in the market behind the screen. It can be seen that the current movie market is not mature. Good reputation cannot be transformed into a box office. It is bound to be difficult to develop in a healthy way. There is still a long way to go before Chinese films enter real industrialization. I hope that the director of tension can not be chaotic. As the image moves, insist on creating with the heart, as long as there are good works, with the support of fans, you can certainly keep the time when the clouds open.",movie

867,"The movie &quot;Hunting&quot;, I think it tells a creepy story that is more terrible than any horror film I have ever seen in the true sense. In the eyes of the world, the pure and innocent child, because of a &quot;word&quot;, can actually put an adult as a hunger, and the situation pointed out by thousands of people. The screenwriter has shaped Cara, a four-year-old child in the movie. What is the age of the child? According to relevant research, children generally begin to imagine and logically think at this age. Children can pretend, imagine, reason, perceive, know who you are, who you are, and decide whether you are good to me or me. good for you. The film is based on such an argument and analyzes a desire about children, or a story about each person&#39;s desires. At the beginning of the film, the audience was constantly reminded of Carol&#39;s loneliness. Many times, Carla&#39;s loneliness was revealed in different environments, covering almost all the social relationships of a child. As Lacan said, â€œDesire is lackingâ€, and desire pursues the goal that is lost forever. What Cara lacks is the love from others. This is her desire. The desire and the object can never be absolutely satisfied. That is to use some objects to fill the desire, these objects can only be a substitute for the desire body, not the real body of desire. Another famous saying of Lacan, &quot;Desire is the desire of the other.&quot; Simple satisfaction is simple, and desire needs to be externally expressed and ultimately related to another subject. Things and language are only the agents of desire to appear, and the ultimate pursuit of desire is in the other. So, when Lucas appeared in front of Kara, took her home, took her to school, and played with Lucas&#39;s dog, her face showed a smile that she could not see at home. But when Kara kissed Lucas, Lucas told her seriously that this was a behavior between husband and wife. When they could not, Karaâ€™s desire was once again in a state of unsustainable maintenance. &quot;Fantasy refers not to the need for satisfaction, but to the unsatisfied desire.&quot; To be precise, the function of fantasy is to maintain desire rather than satisfy desire. Kara sat in the kindergarten director&#39;s office and waited for her mother. And the dean said Lucas sexually invaded himself, and the details are very detailed. The film has been partially explained before. When Cara played for the second time, my brother&#39;s classmates ran an erotic picture to show her, and at the same time said some sloppy words. These words are used by Kara to describe the details. Some viewers here wonder whether Kara is deliberately lying or fantasizing? The answer should be the latter.When adults ask about kindergarten children about Lucas, these innocent children seem to have become annoying lie. This is actually their fantasy. But why do all children have such a clear illusion of directivity? Children like Kara are already capable of speaking. In Lacan&#39;s theory, once a child learns a language, he rushes out of the &quot;real&quot; world and into a new world. This new world is constructed by linguistic symbols, that is, the symbolic world in Lacan&#39;s &quot;Three Realms Theory.&quot; Most children have similar fantasies. I think the biggest reason is that children are already in a group. They are like the adults who are collectively unconscious. &quot;When the human consciousness disappears and the unconscious personality prevails, thoughts and feelings are contagious by the power of suggestion, and collective consciousness turns to a common direction, suggesting that information will soon turn into action.&quot; Therefore, their behavior It can be discussed together in the collective unconscious. The same reason can also analyze the behavior of all adults who are hostile to Lucas. After watching the movie, I tried to pull my personal emotions away from the whole story, but I was still surrounded by the pain of depression, which is almost desperate. It is hard not to sympathize with the protagonist. When the spectator fans are clear, it is difficult for the Qing people to clear themselves, and it is a fact that the lie repeats thousands of times. Most parents unconsciously believe that children are innocent angels, and that they may not be aware of them or they may be devastating demons.",movie
868,"When you step into a city, you feel the deepest, perhaps not the bustling streets, the tall buildings towering into the clouds?? Such fanaticism and dazzling are the burning self, the big city is a huge ant colony, people Traveling through knowledge, wealth and youth, as if it seems to be a purposeful team, but in the end it is just a small worker ant on the road of exhaustion; and you close your eyes and hear the life?? Bargaining, whispering whispers, easy and pleasant reminders of passers-by&#39;s horns and even the sound of regular garbage dumping every morning, they are slow-paced, perhaps boring, but real and warm. The warm body is a kind of material carrier that will be destroyed, and the sound that penetrates the soul is always in our past and present, as if we are laughing at our superficiality and numbness. And the wind that screamed past our ears from history and far away, but gradually no sound. In the country, the world that has been so sensitive and so lively has inadvertently changed many of them. When you look back, it seems that only a huge hollow is left, in the history of the country, and in everyoneâ€™s In my heart. The sound of the village of Abu Dhaden remains in the warmth that has not yet been taken away. It has the freedom and joy of coming and going, the strong and straightforwardness of Cantuman breaking into the soil, the twists and turns of the blacksmith&#39;s shop hammering the hammer... People live here, but they are not willing In the upper reaches of the city where the Huangsha line will pass, it can&#39;t carry so many desires, and the heart of their progressive evolution has changed step by step. When looking back, it will never return. And precisely because of this, they chose to dig the hole, which is the habit of Abu Dhabi, and the only hope of Abu Dhabi. They dig a city under the ground, a city that carries their dreams? It is the gold and silver left by the ancestors, they can sell them to improve their lives; this city is the belief that the shadows have shed blood, and the influence of their dying in life can be recalled here; the city Itâ€™s their secrets. People are secretive. It seems to be guarding one&#39;s last hope. And one day, the cave has become a disaster, and their dreams are broken. Just like in this remote village, the peace was broken. . The oil pipeline took away the black gold in the ground, but did not bring work to the Kantomans; the motorcycle invaded the living space of the brakes, but the mourning of Wan Yi did not change.The fate of slaughter; when people discover a city and discover a city, they become their nightmare; and another city under the cave has not accelerated its transformation: bit by bit, they are forgotten, left out, and gradually lose their voice. . It is better to say that the outside world can no longer hear their voices. They are also reluctant to use the force to call the number. This is the loss of the villages of Cantuman and Abu Dhabi, but it is also the loss of thousands of villages with individuality and happiness to try to keep themselves. Their silence and sorrow are in everyone&#39;s heart. The change of the image of a building belonging to a city and a village on the outside is just an illusion; people should close their eyes to find the emotions in their voices. The hollow in the ground is like the vacancy in people&#39;s voices, which makes us have a faint sadness in our hearts. &quot;The village disappeared when they came back. The place where the generations lived became an invincible crater. They shouted around the pit, shouted and fell, they cried, the cry fell, the moon and the sun fell... until they put all The pits are filled, all the holes are blocked, and the life of one generation is used.&quot; &quot;At that time, isnâ€™t it a hairy man standing next to them? Is it not Kantoman on their shoulders?&quot; Or, the world has never Haven&#39;t they been there? Because you listen, there has never been such a voice. 2013-11-10 22:52:21",movie

A genius with a very developed mind should recognize that thinking is the root of the problem. Donâ€™t use the mind too much, but use the theory to feel it. difficult. We praise the courage of one person, not necessarily relative to others, but precisely to this person. When Nash decided not to feed the dreams of the heart, those who existed, but did not have a big impact. I think this must be difficult, just as we all saw Nash&#39;s illusion, but did not think about his words: they are my past, and each of us has been entangled in the past. Under the influence of the past, everyone can construct a theory that belongs to their own world, and under the influence of its recurring operation, it will continue to feed those illusory things until they can&#39;t tell the truth or indulge in it. At the end of the film, Nash won the Nobel Prize and the warmth of the whole family. However, in reality,And his sons are all schizophrenic on the free campus of Princeton. Indeed, we can&#39;t do anything because of this, because God has his own reason, all arrangements are reasonable existence, for himself, for others, for everything.",movie
876,"Oscar Wilde once said that it is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People only have interesting and boring differences. In the film &quot;The Trouble in Heaven&quot;, it is easy for us to glimpse the relationship between money and lust, which is also a drawback of the upper class. We can regard jewelry as a symbol of lust, and in this film, theft is the way to satisfy this lust. The male thief and the female thief are burning fire, you yell at me, between them, theft has become a way of flirting. Liu Bieqin&#39;s comedy techniques used in this film are similar to the white painting techniques commonly used in literature. At the opening of the film, the night scene of Venice, a cleaner who sings Italian opera, and interesting pens outline the Venetian artistic atmosphere. This also implies some unexpected confusion and disgust under the glamorous shell of this society. At first, the male thief and the female thief appeared in the audience&#39;s field of vision as the count, and two people could not help but have a love for men and women. Male thieves such as gentlemen are generally polite, female thieves such as ladies generally want to refuse to welcome. The most interesting is the romantic details that make the moon reflected in the wine. When the male thief and the female thief enjoyed this romantic dinner, the news of the theft was frequently heard in the next door, and the identity of the two people gradually surfaced. These shots outline the secrets of the high society, the unlovable male love, the thief&#39;s identity exposure and contest. Liu Bieqian used a simple set of lenses to mix these three different emotions together, and did not make people feel that the sins hidden behind the song and dance were more unexpected fun. The feelings between the male thief and the female thief also heated up rapidly at this time. Due to the similarity of identity, the mutual worship and appreciation of the other partyâ€™s theft technology gradually turned into a lust. Here, Liu Bieque used a very clever lens to explain the two. Personal behavior, after two and two, there is only one empty sofa in the lens. This lens has succeeded in creating a &quot;sexual&quot; expression that Hollywood has been using ever since. Jean Renoir once said: Modern Hollywood movies were initiated by Liu Bieqian. From this clever erotic scene, we can easily understand why Renoir praised Liu Bieqian so much. Liu Bieqian strives to be compact, coherent and indirect in the narrative. Therefore, when describing the life of the rich woman, he used only a few shots to quickly edit the living space, interpersonal scope and communication hobbies of Fu Po. It also clarifies the emotional state, personal life, and economic status of Fu Po, and it is a smart way to edit it.District Kirk&#39;s &quot;The Psychic&quot; also got a more perfect interpretation. In addition, there is a lens that can show Liu Beiqian&#39;s sophistication and wisdom in the editing. The lens is always aligned with the alarm clock. According to the change of the alarm clock pointer, the light changes, a small amount of narration, showing the relationship between the rich woman and the male thief. Relationships and changes in emotions. Liu Bieqian used a simple lens to make the clichÃ©s and tedious paragraphs in the film omit, which is enough to express Liu Bianqian&#39;s wisdom in editing. Liu Bianqian&#39;s shooting technique influenced many later directors, Wilder, Ozu and so on. The fixed photography that Liu Bianqian used was also the style that Xiaojin Anjiro emulated. Liu Bieqian&#39;s urban comedy likes to set the background of the story abroad. The story of &quot;The Problem in Heaven&quot; is in Paris. The story of &quot;Street Shop&quot; is Budapest and so on. This kind of urban style and exotic atmosphere is in the story of Liu Bieqian. It is only a means, not an end. His shots are focused on the character&#39;s mood, manners, and changes in expression, which is common in his silent films. Another interesting phenomenon in &quot;The Troubles in Heaven&quot; is that Italian, Russian, German, Spanish, etc. interspersed during this period. This way of expressing comedy is borrowed from many movies, especially domestic comedy movies. Learn from this way to achieve the effect of comedy. The spiritual state and emotional state of the characters in the metropolis are inseparable from the monetary interests. Liu Bieqinâ€™s comedy in the metropolis is finally resolved by the identity of the characters. The plot of the whole movie followed the change of the identity of the male thief. On the last night, Liu Bieqian still used a simple lens, two doors, two windows, two rooms to interpret this interesting triangle love. In the end, the male thief and the female thief successfully embarked on the road of happy and happy, they used the theft to show each other&#39;s relatives in the original way, using their superb professional means to flirt. &quot;The troubles in heaven&quot; has influenced many movies of later generations. Hitchcock&#39;s &quot;Catch the Thief&quot; and &quot;The Thief&quot; are inspired by this film.",movie
877,"Does China have horror movies? The answer to this question is that many fans will answer &quot;Yes&quot; in unison! So, does China have a good horror film? I am afraid this question is not so good to answer. To say that China&#39;s horror film, the tens of millions of box office is absolutely big, but the box office and film are not a concept at all. Because the horror film of the box office and word-of-mouth in this year is really much more... Of course, many viewers have said that our countryâ€™s film censorship system has many restrictions on horror films? This canâ€™t be, there is no such thing, so Only led to the horror film is not horrible, not horrified, not scary. But in my opinion, the most fundamental reason why Chinese horror films don&#39;t look good is that they are separated from life and love to make stories. If the big emptiness is not grounded, people will see it is fake, and there is a logically common flaw in the movie. How do you like to watch it? However, the thrilling suspense movie &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦&quot; released on the 8th has completely become an alternative existence. This movie is not only non-stubborn, not nonsense, the most important thing is that the story is close to life and grounded, so it is definitely a recent year. Itâ€™s rare to let the audience sink into the ass and see the real Chinese horror movie! In the past, horror movies either occurred in a haunted house, or went to a wilderness, or an isolated island overseas. Then the mobile communication was completely interrupted, and the sky should not be called the ground, and the ghosts would not be seen in the scene. It is not the grave that is attached to the gloomy photo. Think about it carefully, except for sb, I am afraid that no one will run this kind of scene to travel and explore... Is it really scary to find death in this place? Therefore, this type of horror film is not only all nonsense. IQ is hard to say, but it is also anxious. &quot;Carpooling&quot; is very different from this horror film. It tells the story of several carpoolers on a rainy night. Among them are the elements of horror and horror, the ridicule of reality, and the lines that make people slap. The most important thing is to restore the encounters and stories of each carpooler through multi-line narrative, so that all the protagonists are full and true, and unlike some horror movies, some people know that some people are soy sauce. It is worth mentioning that although there is a &quot;è¯¡&quot; in &quot;è¯¡æ‹¼è½¦&quot;, this is by no means a slap in the face of a &quot;ghost&quot; piece. The film is dominated by surprises rather than ghosts. The whole movie shows that the audience is a malicious act of someone, not a ghost. The experience of carpooling is believed to be common to many people, and it is naturally impossible for carpooling people to be familiar with each other.It is also common to drive a car on the road. Therefore, it is logically reasonable for the driver to open the car and crash the car. It is logically reasonable for all the carpoolers to settle in the villa of the artist played by Bao Xiaobo in the rainy night. Among these people who are carpooling, there are lascivious drivers, dare women who dare to go out in the same industry, female rock climbers who have suffered from love setbacks but are passionate about adventures, and women lawyers who are not very reliable. Of course, in this era of female guns, the female maidens are also indispensable. In addition to this, there is also an unidentified tough guy on the road. It can be said that this pedestrian is a wide variety of industries, and there are people with stories, so the story between them is naturally very good. In addition to the intriguing nature of the characters, the atmosphere of creating horror for suspense thrillers is obviously the most important, and Bao Xiaobai, who is also the director of music and soundtracks, personally performs the game, and the soundtrack of the film is always at the most. The shocking place is stagnant. Bringing the most horrible atmosphere and adding a lot to the film. Of course, in order to increase the suspenseful element, the directorâ€™s tension also pays tribute to the suspense master Hitchcock, introducing the crow in the â€œFlock of Birdsâ€ as an important role in the film, especially at the end of the film, which also buried a tail. The feeling of horror is further sublimated at the last moment. Of course, scaring people for scary is obviously not the ultimate goal of suspense thrillers. Through the film, let people understand the truth of life and break the heart is the key. The same is true for the movie &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦&quot;. The artist who can&#39;t extricate himself in the pain can&#39;t get out of the pain, while others can&#39;t find the direction in the entanglement and confusion. However, after a night of carpool distress, the driver and the prostitute woman candidly meet each other, female lawyer and mother. The gunmen are connected by heart, and the rock climbers played by Ni Jingyang also discover the love and friendliness of the artist. Itâ€™s a particularly sincere horror film, which is not arbitrarily created and not deceived by people. Itâ€™s a story of simple living language and grounded atmosphere to impress the audience.",movie

In fact, the two men called on the stage to fight, the nose and eyes were swollen, it didn&#39;t mean anything, it didn&#39;t make much sense. Moreover, a former boxer re-entered the stage, and the things to be carried are heavier than the young people who were born, and one of them is a pain. &quot;I haven&#39;t done anything for myself for twenty years!&quot; And some stories always hope to make irrational reasons into a song.

I didn&#39;t expect the picture and special effects to be comparable to Transformers, and the fighting scene was stronger than the Transformers. Although they were not durable and not delicate enough, they were at least shocking and big. Bean friends said that it is a movie version of EVA, I agree, but the battle scene with EVA is much more than the ring. However, EVA was the savior of Japanese anime at the time, and it was not epoch-making, because the background of religion was relatively small. I have been unable to spit on the monsters. For so many years, the monsters are still the same, and who is the monster or the aliens must be so disgusting? When I saw the mech and the monster fighting, I thought it was Altman. It was so special. Is there any speech in the film before the final attack? I suddenly felt that the super speaker was weak. It seems that the use of wormholes, passages, parallel universes, and aliens has begun to increase. This is a very good phenomenon and progress. I always feel that after Avatar, such movies have begun to slowly improve, or have been transformed. I really donâ€™t dare to think about what it will be in a few years.

The highlight lies in Lao Shiâ€™s German-language show. He was also surprised that he could speak such a fluent German. Later, he reacted. The family name has revealed the Germanic origin.

I also started to communicate with my sister-in-law and prostitutes. From the beginning of the withdrawal, the little girl slowly accepted the uncle and told him about the process. The old history began with the nightclub owner, the manager of the bar, and the young man in the bar. One by one, but he also encountered resistance and someone wanted him to leave.

884,"Jiangsu Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;I am a special soldier&#39;s fire Phoenix&quot; is coming to an end, and the fans are both expecting and reluctant to come to the upcoming finale. There have been many similar military themes in the past, and why the &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot; can be so fired, because it has taken advantage of the strengths of the family, using three magic weapons to capture the audience: First, the fast pace of American drama. Although there are 56 episodes, there are few places in the plot, and there are no essays and martial arts. Second, the real &quot;pasta&quot;, the actresses experienced the real guns of the devil training. The effect presented will naturally give the audience a more exciting experience. Third, the female martial arts soldiers do not forget the sexy, the fire phoenix changed the inherent impression of the female soldiers&#39; rough and tough squad. The hard posture of the eight phoenixes in the difficult training also made many men admire, inadvertently revealed. Innocent and petite also shaped the first batch of female special forces on the screen. I have to say that the title of this drama is very apt, fire phoenix, take the phoenix nirvana, the meaning of rebirth, the dying phoenix into the fire, the new life in the fire, become a beautiful and eternal fire phoenix. In this drama, eight female soldiers from different places and different positions in order to form a women&#39;s special force, do not cope with pain, no reconciliation, constant pursuit, self-improvement and the phoenix coincide. Among the eight phoenix phoenixes, the most admired and admired is that Ye Xiaoye, who plays the role of Liu Xiaojie, is not only a superior family, but also a veritable rich second generation, and she is a high student of the Tsinghua Computer Department. She has extraordinary wisdom and is difficult to understand. Why did Bai Fumei choose to be a soldier, but also to be one of the most difficult special forces, but she did not defend her heart. For the ideals of her heart, her constant efforts and hard work, she lost her former tenderness and pride, and experienced many hardships. Finally, it became a steel warrior with beautiful, brave and intelligent. Liu Xiaojie&#39;s handling of this character is very delicate. It enriches the role with a little bit of change, convincing the audience, and letting everyone see the insurmountable sense of accomplishment when people make their dreams hard and finally achieve real life value. And satisfaction. Then, back to the original doubts, Bai Fumeiâ€™s reason for asking for a bitter special soldier was solved. Liu Xiaojie, a young actor from Nanjing Art College, is no stranger to everyone. Before &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot;, Liu Xiaojie and director Liu Meng had two tacit cooperations. In the first two parts of the special forces series, she shouldered The soul figure in the drama, &quot;Special Soldier 1&quot;, she played the small shadow let us first know the female soldier&#39;s cool and spicy posture,It can be regarded as the predecessor of &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot;, and in &quot;Special Forces 2&quot;, her gentle and kind and infatuated Lin Xiaoxiao also made the audience worry. This time, &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot;, she once again dedicated a new image, beauty and wisdom coexist, personality and rebellion are indistinguishable, Bai Fumei and female men are free to convert. Ye Yuanxin is a complex complex, but Liu Xiaojie has just rightly matched each side of the complex and matched it properly. Perhaps this is inseparable from Liu Xiaojie&#39;s perseverance and perseverance. During the filming, Liu Xiaojie had a fever of 39 degrees, but still took turns between Group A and Group B. The strength of not accepting the loss was comparable to that of Ye. In the play, Ye Jinxin entered the training camp and he did not know how to settle down with An Lanping, and gradually developed a sincere friendship. Liu Xiaojieâ€™s interpretation of this friendship is a bit ingenious, like Max in the bankrupt sisters. And Caroline, although sometimes looks like a tit-for-tat, does not give each other, but in the eyes of outsiders is very love, so the netizen kicked off the lover in Shen Lanni&#39;s play, but she called Ye Yuanxin and her as the official match of &quot;Fire Phoenix&quot;. After the same sisters died together, after all the hardships, Ye Yuanxin became more and more sharp. When the pair of smiling eyes released sharp eyes, she was like &quot;Nikita&quot;, hidden behind the firm figure. The unique fatal appeal of women, such as the grounded air and the international fan of the heart, it is no wonder that the audience love, never forget.",movie
885,"PS: This is actually the diary after I read the two stories of this book today. I don&#39;t intend to involve other authors. Please don&#39;t mind if you accidentally see this Liu Wei teacher. I think, in my diary, how can you see my thoughts &quot;in case&quot;. For those who don&#39;t want to open this log, please forgive me for breaking up, because I love Liu Wei too, hehe. This article has nothing to do with the plot in the book. Right is a monologue of a small fan. There was no shift in the afternoon clinic, and there was a half-day holiday on the Singles Day. This was too cruel for me. I was standing tall and I had to vacate my time to let me face this cruel fact. In today&#39;s grand festival of almost &quot;Taobao&quot;, I silently chose to ignore it, because the purse is dry, because I don&#39;t want to wait for a long wait to meet the courier. So I went back to my room and quickly got into the bed, and it was best to sleep on my head. At the moment, the door was ringed by &quot;å’šå’š&quot;. I suddenly sat up and ran out. Oh, I finally waited for the &quot;gift&quot; of the middle-aged man who had a few faces. Ah, I thought I would receive it tomorrow. Amazon ordered the book, actually delivered in advance, courier anger, oh, call you still not answered. I smirked at him cheeky. To pay for the card, what about the card? Where is my bank card going? I borrowed the roommate&#39;s first brush, then flipped the card in the room, the card! Card it! Ah, bad, the first two days, I took the money. After the withdrawal, there is no card, it must be like this. I also rushed to the bank at the door of the community, and it was there. This is the nth time to forget to pull the card. But it doesn&#39;t matter, because of my book, they are here. Liu Weiâ€™s &quot;No Defamation&quot;, Zhang Jiajia&#39;s &quot;From Your World&quot;. Liu Wei used to be the signing author of &quot;Huaxi&quot; and &quot;South Wind&quot;. At that time, I was still a 13-year-old girl, and I was already immersed in the adult love world written by those who told the story. One day I read Liu Wei, and I remember that the article was &quot;Can we not be brave&quot;, at first sight. Her writing is different from many romance writers. Without you, I don&#39;t have a passion for love. Instead, I use a narrative style, a simple and concise term, and an in-depth explanation. The girl in her pen, the golden light shining over the beautiful woman of the sentient beings is no longer the female lord. The kind-hearted, good-spirited girl with a shy temperament is the real card in the story. In her Weibo, I saw a lot like me.A girl who followed her all the way from childhood. When she got her book and read two stories, she was ups and downs, excitedly on the Weibo Aite, telling her that even today is a rare Singles Day in history, because her book does not feel lonely, no I thought she forwarded my Weibo and left a serious sentence to me. &quot;Listening to you is really warm. But I hope, you will meet that person, hand in hand to give sunshine every afternoon.&quot; Every day is turned into a holiday tune. &quot;The author who is so intimate and warm, there is really no way to not love. So, the window was cold, but there was a daylight into the window sill. In such an ordinary and special afternoon, I played some music and read the stories of urban men and women who were concise and warm in her writing. After reading one, I wrote a little thought with the pencil at the end of the text. I think so many people like her story, perhaps because we are ordinary people, smearing the light that others shine, we are so small, but also the protagonist who shines on their own stage. So, can I forgive myself for always forgetting to forget the important bank card, can you forgive that I have had some sad feelings, maybe because I am not good enough, not as thoughtful as a girl should have, Gentle and careful, but I can also be a girl like her. There is no shocking face, no excellent resume, but I am a kind and casual person. I asked Liu Wei, our ordinary girl is worth it. Itâ€™s not right to meet one and another excellent actor, she said, â€œOf course, simple, happy, loving, and loving, the girlâ€™s love is like this. I think itâ€™s worthy of being loved.â€ Thank you. Teacher Liu Wei, because you, every ordinary day like today, can no longer say that tomorrow will not be yesterday, because today, your story brings me confidence and expectation. Well, as for Zhang Jiajiaâ€™s book, I donâ€™t have to say more. Every diehard microblogging party must be like me, tears for his story. Therefore, life is like this, we think that the plain years, perhaps because of their own enthusiasm, do not dare to move forward. Even if you just open a book, life can immediately add color to the cocktails. Yesterday, my father gave me a call. He always said that he was arrogant, and he said happily, my daughter, when the spring blooms next year, your favorite person will appear. I smiled and said that he has many things. I know how much he and my mother are expecting me to be happy, but my parents, donâ€™t youAnxious, my ordinary girl, there is no such thing as a terrible story, and let me dance gracefully in the years of solitude, when more melody of life is played.

886,"There are many implicit meanings of cave metaphor. Plato has formed a mutually supportive philosophical system in its own metaphor, line metaphor, hole metaphor, ship metaphor and drug metaphor. The topic involves basic ontology epistemology, Taoist political philosophy and educational philosophy. This is a big deal. The theme of &quot;The Ideal Country&quot; and &quot;Hui Dian&quot; complement each other and complement each other. From the metaphor of the cave, the philosopher who returns to the cave to complete the birth of the soul happens to correspond to the discussion of spiritual birth and physical birth in &quot;Hui Dian&quot;. The laity is born by the flesh, while the philosopher gives birth in the soul. Philosophy is higher than city-state, and philosophy is to guide politics. This is the basic judgment of Plato. Under such judgment, the philosophers return to the cave with a lot of extended meanings: 1. Why did the philosopher return to the cave? The philosopher returns to the cave out of love for the cave, and the philosopher cannot live alone on the ground. He needs the living environment provided by the city. 2. The philosophers have to take care of the fires of the caves because of love and responsibility, but they realize that their natural life is limited (cannot live forever), so they must find the successor, and must complete the formal &quot;self-cloning&quot;? More people must be guided out of the cave. After such a series of major metaphors and profound reflections, Plato gave the urgency and necessity of education for the first time under the urgency of the philosopher&#39;s pursuit of caring for the civilization of the city-state (we can still hear Rousseau in the future). , Kant and Dewey and others have a big discussion on this issue). Plato&#39;s educational philosophy can be divided into two levels according to the object. The first level is the guardian class of the city state (mainly related to sports and music education). The second layer is also Plato&#39;s most concerned with the selection and education of potential philosophers, including advanced knowledge such as geometry, arithmetic and dialectics. However, Plato&#39;s philosophy of education seems to be aristocratic and elite. I have not read any of the &quot;Ideology&quot; in the whole country. I have not seen any design of the education of the city-state people of the copper and iron souls. Instead, they ridicule and refute these people in many places. Plato&#39;s silence on the educational activities of these people may be regardless of whether or not they ask. For the first time, Plato&#39;s educational philosophy directly and systematically confessed or concealed the interrelated issues: 1. Why educate? This is a question of the legitimacy of educational activities. 2. The goal and orientation of education (crawling out of the cave, seeing the sky and the sun, and returning to the cave) 3. How to select young people to apply education, what should be the stage content of education (small timeMusical cultivation, poetry purification and physical education, after the age of 30, after examination, can learn dialectics) 4. What kind of people can best complete education? (The philosopher, seeing a brighter person, seeing the eternal order) 5. The conflict between educational activities and city-state relations and the solution of the golden soul can no longer covet gold and silver, but it is necessary for the city-state to raise the philosopher and allow it within a considerable limit. Tolerate their free teaching. For the philosophers who are engaged in city-state management, they will be sent to Furen Island when they are old, so that they can concentrate on continuing their philosophical activities and enjoy their later years. The solution to this problem is also an attempt at the level of political philosophy, perhaps the earliest philosophy of life. The plan of the way.",movie

Judging from the information of &quot;Golden Spies&quot;, which was recently exposed by Lafeng Media, the drama is mainly about suspense and spy warfare. Although there are many elements of love, palace fighting and conspiracy, the main character Jiang Yi plays the Korâ€™s Department. Beller Batu, the relationship with An Yixuan&#39;s Doro Huizhe County, is like the Sherlock Holmes&#39;s detective duo, which brings a rather different comedy style of detective drama to the show. Although the two were a man and a woman, they formed a detective image of the duo in the drama. The popularity of the film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; and the British drama &quot;Sherlock&quot; is a popular form of reasoning &quot;two-person group&quot;. Not long ago, &quot;Di Renjie God Dragon King&quot; also offered Zhao Youting + Lin Xin, Zhao Youting + Feng Shaofeng, a serious and funny, one-piece and one-wu &quot;combination duo&quot; form, allows the gag and the serious case to be integrated into one, and receives a strong entertainment effect. The relationship between Batu (Jiang Yi) and Cai Die (An Yi Xuan) in &quot;Golden Spear&quot; is also full of tension and fun. When they were young, they used to be married, but when they grew up, their personality was very different. The situation of not seeing each other was like the death of Shen Shizhen and Cuizhi in Zhang Ailing&#39;s novel &quot;Eighteen Springs&quot;. Such a pair of men and women, filled with the rhythm of the oolong who does not love each other, brings a sense of joy, but also adjustsThe dark and tense rhythm of the main story brings multiple entertainment pleasures, bringing a breath of breath for the atmosphere of suspenseful reasoning. This has to be said to be a very effective and easy-to-color figure. In addition to being unique in the above aspects, Lafeng Media is also an exquisite lineup in the actor. Huang Haibing, Tang Zhenye, Tang Zhenzong, Mi Xue, Chen Zixin, Chen Sihan and so on joined the old and middle-aged dramas, which laid the foundation for the performance of the show. The basic level. Liu Tingyu, a young actor who once played an important role in &quot;Shenzhen Espionage&quot;, plays the role of Wang Liwu, the daughter of Doro Xuanxian County, and her arrogant personality. She secretly loves Batu, picking butterflies, and thus two In addition to the relatively stable character relationship, the protagonist brings fresh and stimulating variables, but also brings an unknown danger. In addition, Hui Yinghongâ€™s character in the drama is a sinister martial artist who has brought a taste of Hong Kong martial arts film. This character is old and fierce, and the eagle dog who is willing to be expensive is conspiring to retaliate after falling out of favor, secretly planning a bloody case, let People think of the English fox played by Zheng Pei Pei in &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;.

888,"When you write down the word &quot;China&quot; and try to outline a picture of the current Chinese society through your own observations, you will probably feel desperate, because you will find that everything is just futile. This country with the world&#39;s largest population and rapid economic development is too complicated, versatile, rich and difficult to understand, so that all so-called objectiveness becomes one-sided, just like Zhang Yuhe&#39;s book. The topic of â€œworking girlsâ€ is not very attractive, and the word itself has exposed the limitations and tendencies of the topic. Compared to her husband Peter Heisler&#39;s first two books, the popular and popular, Zhang Yihe, who is also a writer and journalist, lacks in vision, observation, or depth of writing. Does not hinder the sale of this book in the Chinese market. In fact, the chapters that China is performing every day during the transition period, even the most magical realist writers are hard to match, and the non-fiction is in the ascendant, which is also an echo of this reality, whether it is He Weiâ€™s &quot;Pathfinder China&quot; or Liang Hongâ€™s &quot;Liang Liang Zhuang Ji&quot; focuses on the special community of Chinese villages and peasants in a zero-distance writing approach to reality, because this complex living environment is occupied by a group of nearly half of China&#39;s population. More able to reflect today&#39;s China. However, it is worth noting that the duality of Zhang Yuhe&#39;s Chinese identity can, on the one hand, enable him to observe the phenomenon that has long been used by locals as an outsider, and to give readers a defamiliar experience; but at the same time his ancestors The inextricable connection with this land has also led to a layer of cultural â€œshadowsâ€ in the process of narrative, a kind of indistinct alienation and closeness, love and hate complex emotions, from time to time. The ground will flash in the narrative gap, and the reader&#39;s judgment will be left and right. Narratives are never objective, because the material itself already contains a certain angle and prejudice. She will focus on the â€œvillage girl who goes to work in the cityâ€. Many people know that the peasants are at the bottom of the hierarchical structure of China as a whole, and there is a more subtle division in this bottom layer. China is always under the patriarchal power. In view of this cultural concept, rural girls are at the bottom of the bottom layer. They are born in rural areas, but most of them do not plant land. They do not have kinship with the land. They seem to be more free to become free and become a member of the city. But it also means that once you don&#39;t fit in the city, you don&#39;t have to rely on it when you return to the countryside. So the state of existence in this gap makes the girls who appear in the book will be headed or settled in the city.Your own life goals. From this point of view, whether it is Lu Qingmin who has been transferred to several factories, Wu Xinming who is engaged in pyramid schemes, or even a senior white-collar worker who is not between the CBDs in the whole sunrise, there is no difference in essence, and the road to the ultimate is thousands. Ten thousand, but the ultimate goal is so consistent. Since the rise of the nationâ€™s wages since the 1990s, it has been in the ascendant. Guangdong, the most developed province in the manufacturing industry, is the gathering point of this trend, and Dongguan is a microcosm. As the authors say, this South China city will almost all of China&#39;s current extreme development to the extreme, dirty, utilitarian, speculative, impetuous, money worship... This city is famous for its mistresses and processing plants, no matter where it goes. The root cane is followed by a bottomless pit. If you don&#39;t pay attention, you will be broken. Here is the home base of industrial workers in the South, and it is also the source of tragedy and sin. With the details in the book, I was able to restore the image of a â€œmutantâ€ city in my mind, and before that, my impression of Dongguan came from one of my college students. Typical middle-class families, second-floor houses, family businesses, strong financial resources, studying abroad... Locals and migrant workers, like two parallel-dimensional worlds, seem to never intersect, but at the same time exist in a piece of land. I have to admit that reading this kind of work is not a pleasant experience for me. It forces me to return to the land I am trying to open, return to the group that has been intentionally or unintentionally forgotten, and return to my starting point. Combine your own personal experience to re-evaluate and think about the era, society and personal return path in the trajectory of others. No matter how I cover up, the consciousness that has already been imprinted in the depths of the gene can never be erased. Those working girls who are gradually drifting away are actually the entities that once appeared in my life, some are my primary school students, some are my loved ones. We are all bearers of history, moving in the hands of destiny, unable to escape and can not escape. In this fast-changing country, it is only these words that can be eternal for the drifters who leave the country: the easiest thing in the world is to lose contact with people.",movie

892,"&quot;Hundreds of Mills&quot; is the best documentary of the 2012 Golden Horse Awards. Its behind-the-scenes production line will make people think of Zhang Qiaoyong&#39;s previous work &quot;Along the River&quot; (the film also won the Golden Horse Award for best documentary) and Fan Lixin&#39;s &quot;Homecoming Train&quot;. This batch of Chinese documentaries produced in strict accordance with the industrialization process, from the elaboration of the preliminary investigation preparation to the meticulousness of the post-production, is completely different from a mainland independent documentary of DV. In the eyes of the sharp-minded authors, these documentaries with &quot;Canada&#39;s foreign perspectives&quot; appear to lack positions, have a vague attitude, and are not close to the complex reality of the current Chinese society, let alone those sharp political issues. So, must the documentary make a certain gesture? Obviously not. If you recall the series of documentaries by Ogawa Yusuke, he turned from a vigorous social movement to a humanistic study in the rural areas. His works are unpretentious and the level is high. In contrast, the ethos of mainland documentary film creation is &quot;too much to make a documentary&quot;, so that the theme is first. You don&#39;t have to look at the content, you are first attracted to the theme, you can also identify the director&#39;s path, and finally the movie is also firmly framed, and it is extremely poor in terms of image expression. In a word, these documentaries ignore the film ontology and are far from being called &quot;good-looking movies.&quot; &quot;Thousands of hammers and smashing&quot; cleverly solved the above problems. Many people can&#39;t believe that the same machine, the domestic independent director shot, how to see how rough, the color is wrong, the sound is too flat, and no one is arrested. Many people may have to say that it is the late investment of people, a penny of goods. However, see the numerous seats in the film, the way in which the devil is trained, the close-up angle of constant change, and the frequent switching of conversations and dialogues. The success of this &quot;Thousands of Tricks and Tricks&quot; may not be a unilateral reason, nor will it be Saving money. In fact, the boxing movement in a poor county and city, the fringe project in the fringe area, and the description of the light, many people will not agree. It is precisely this kind of disapproval, they will subvert many things, let you accept to reconsider. No one knows why boxing is going to bloom in Sichuan. The film says some problems (poverty), but it doesn&#39;t explain everything. Imagine, when the coach told the children that boxing will take you to the world, why don&#39;t we think that reading a good book will take the world. Whether knowledge is more powerful than physical fitness, no one actually knows. A scientist is more important than a musician, and many people have already defaulted to this fact. So, back to boxing, aroundThe &quot;cruel&quot; coat of the sport made the parents of the poor family cry, so it is not surprising that the entanglements in the &quot;Thousands of the Hurry&quot; are born. In fact, it can be said that very few people are really enjoying boxing and taking it as a part of life that cannot be separated. It is too difficult to know how easy it is to do. The film tells a lot of unrelated festivals, young people are looking at the street, the guys are sizzling in the hoes... The people in the county town come and go, the mornings in the country are lingering. Inadvertently, &quot;Thousands of Hundreds of Refinings&quot; portrays a rare county town style record. Moreover, it does not exist independently. Following the direction of the film characters, it presents a clear profile of the Chinese society, their family members, their emotional sustenance, their retreat and uneasiness. The director is so subtly hiding behind the camera. He does not say whether the good or bad of Chinese boxing is good or bad. The audience guesses it. In the definition of successful learning, the three characters of &quot;Thousands of Happiness&quot; are all failed. Many people say that losers are not enough to talk about love and talk about feelings, but there is a fact that is such a situation. Sometimes, giving up a dream is much more difficult than insisting on a dream. The moving paragraphs in the film include the guy who has been learning boxing for many years (the provincial sports champion) and was forced to go to the construction site to sell hard work. The master who longed for the golden belt and retired, was knocked down by the Japanese on the stage. Some people will say that it is frustrating. So what is the significance of leaving these paragraphs? I think, that is what I mentioned earlier? The courage to accept failure, these three witty boxers, they are not good at expressing, but by getting along with boxing, the audience is not difficult to feel their fighting spirit, they want to realize their dreams. Various efforts. Many people are afraid of failure, avoiding failures and thinking that they can&#39;t lift their heads. But in fact, life is not like that. Boxing itself is a sport that constantly knocks down opponents and is defeated. What I really want to reflect is, in addition to boxing, what an athlete should do and what he has. Occupation and amateur, where are their metrics. Not everyone can be Ali, and no one can become Zou Shiming. If boxing is to be universal, then its philosophy and spirit should be more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Simply speaking violence or cruelty, the pressure on the physical body, boxing is not necessarily more harmful than the weightlifting and other projects. If you read &quot;Thousands of Hundreds of Refinings&quot; and you understand this, then boxing should be more inspiring to the human mind. ã€Beijing Youth Dailyã€‘",movie

Itâ€™s a bit uncomfortable to read. In this book, what can be read is a few conceptual findings, but the substance is not significant. Their stories, the beginning of the story, and the stories of a few geniuses are just stories, more like stories, stories, and so on.

It is thought that the opponent will scream at the West, so he is ready to be heavily guarded. As a result, he is cut into the chest and shocked when he looks at the other side. I did not care about it and decided to go away. Then I thought: This is another work by Boris Vian who wrote the &quot;The Bubble of the Year&quot; in the light walking on the faucet and the beautiful water lily in the chest? The small freshness instantly changed the taste. But you can count on a story that only has a decent and demeanor in a life that must be had, but is not decisive, in a life that only squanders the novel, because he still has to compose music, Translation, research mathematics, making joinery art, painting, and playing the trumpet... What kind of person is he? Perhaps his good friend Sartre is not sure to make it clear. In the 1940s, when the black crime novels were booming in the United States, the French ushered in the generous salvation of the Allies. The black novels from the United States of America from the Depression also flowed into France as a representative of popular culture. . The crimes and despair that the Great Depression breeds have led to the annihilation of black novels, always the same as carnival. And what does all this have to do with the French? What is the relationship between racial discrimination in the &quot;I cast aside your grave&quot; and the French? Kevin chose such an entry point and wrote a vowed statement as the author&#39;s preface, indicating that he is only the translator of the book, not the author. The author is a pure American &quot;black&quot; boy who has no American publication. The agency dared to accept the publication as a propaganda gimmick. In the novel, he said in the corner of a bookstore clerk who replaced the male one in a corner: &quot;(He leaves the bookstore to write a book) only writes bestsellers, historical novels, A novel that sings black and white women to sleep and has not been lynched...&quot; The faint feeling that the blacks of the United States originated from the deep pains of life, seems to have become a trick that can be used for recreation, to be honest, In addition to the French people, they know what kind of &quot;painful&quot; life they have in the shame of becoming a national of the German occupying power in World War II. And what kind of mentality does the Frenchman in the war carry in the squad and faintly conveyed the voice of the singer? I think Boris Vian, who wrote the &quot;I cast abandon your grave&quot;, is a sample of the most fascinating black humor that is adored by the respectable abundance, the justice that is greeted, and the ruined ruin. Maybe soThe motivation for creating a novel is a bit sinister, and what kind of creative motives can&#39;t erase the reading pleasure that is attracted while reading the novel. Vien accurately grasps the essence of American black novels: eroticism and vendetta are eternal themes. The protagonist is always the loser of life, showing pessimistic anti-social or socially corrupted postures, and of course the ingenious plot and desperate atmosphere. . Perhaps France, which was brewing the philosophy of great existentialism at the time, and the United States, which emerged from the Great Depression as a savior, chewed different despairs, but shared a sense of meaningless existence. So this novel, through time, came to us who still had the instinct of death, and paid sympathy and sorrow to the evil.",movie
897,"A good suspense horror film, in the story, at least three major reversals of the story. &quot;è¯¡æ‹¼è½¦&quot; has only one story of a musician hurting, and finally explained as a mental illness, slightly thin. Compared with the reversal of the story of &quot;Pen Xian 2&quot; a few months ago, &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦&quot; is obviously outdated. There are also some problems in the context of the film&#39;s characters. The driver and the lost woman disappeared completely in the second half, and letting the interesting characters lose the plot is one of the most important issues. The setting of the role of the father who lost the child, although it can play a role in confusing the audience and increasing the plot to a certain extent, but the final reversal seems to be rushed. The use of blackbird intentions is obviously redundant. Regardless of who pays homage, you must first consider the rationality of the plot. If the original bird is going to go, it is reasonable, then the final shot, the bird flies to the mental patient, it is a failure. The indiscriminate addition of value can only add to the consequences of painting. The film is based on the theme of &quot;carpooling&quot;, but it is just a blind man. This is not a movie that happened on the carpool road, but just a carpooling gimmick to gather several people of different identities into a villa where the mental patient is located. The artist&#39;s mental illness played by Bao Xiaobai, although entering the play, lacks the motivation of character behavior. Why did the artist mentally attack the residents? The film apparently did not explain the problem well. Although there are various problems in the &quot;è¯¡æ‹¼è½¦&quot;, the film is still in line with the suspense and thriller movie in the setting of the character and the plot. The combination of the film effect is basically a pass. The film is trying to construct the character traits of each character and carrying stories for each character. This kind of consciousness is temporarily lacking in many domestically produced movies of the same type. In the plot, although it still has a straightforward problem, it also pays attention to the basic rules, hides the problem of mental illness, and announces it in the last twenty minutes. A smart audience, although it is clear at a glance, it is also necessary to affirm the correctness of these creative ideas, but the technical skills are slightly lacking. This type of film should have some erotic ingredients to increase the point of view. Of course, this concept is purely my personal opinion. Although the &quot;Shu car&quot; lacks sex shots, the big breasts and bare baths of the lost women make up for the lack of certain degrees. Suspense thriller, as a kind of commercial film, is difficult to carry literary value. It is difficult to say that &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦&quot; is the care of the artist&#39;s mental illness. Even so, but in the depth of the character&#39;s personality, you can still doMore kung fu. Under the premise of commercial films, there are highlights, stories, and suspense in filming.

898,"Mr. Lin Gengâ€™s book is not long, and its content is very profound. Itâ€™s awkward. Although he is familiar with some stories in Journey to the West, he knows more about Journey to the West from TV dramas, villains or cartoons. I haven&#39;t seen the real original work of the novel. Mr. Lin Gengâ€™s book actually consists of two parts, one is â€œThe Story of the Story of the Heavenly Palaceâ€ and the other is â€œThe Journey to the Westâ€, which is an in-depth analysis of the story of the characters in The Journey to the West. Regarding the big troubled Tiangong, Sun Wukong has the following points worthy of attention. First, he only relies on his own skills. Second, the cause is very simple, just because the Jade Emperor despised him. Third, the Jade Emperor is not the emperor who is a prestige. Fourth, although Sun Wukong said in the big troubled Tiangong: &quot;The emperor took turns to do it next year, but Sun Wukong did not intend to be a jade emperor.&quot; In the end, the big troubled Tiangong was forced to come out under the Five Elements Mountain because of the underestimation of Sun Wukong. After encountering a career that was considered a hero, he was happy to move into a new career. The so-called big trouble of the Heavenly Palace is nothing more than that Sun Wukong has repeatedly committed crimes with its superb theft. It has not shaken the rule of the Heavenly Palace, nor has any political purpose, or any arrangement or plan. This is not related to the reaction of the peasant uprising. . The image of Sun Wukongâ€™s troubled Tiangong was based on the heroes in the minds of the citizens. This is reflected in the story of the Journey to the West. The storyline of the Heavenly Palace is just a prelude and prelude to the book. It was arranged in the first seven times, which provided a wonderful appearance and outstanding appearance for Sun Wukong. This arrangement is to push Sun Wukong to a Outstanding position and become an indisputable protagonist. It also comprehensively demonstrated the means of Sun Wukong&#39;s sinister change, the extraordinary martial arts, and the character of the hard bones that can withstand the test of failure and suffering. This is also a virtue and reason for his subsequent trip to the West, and the beginning of his heroic career. The dangerous journey of the West Heaven trip is actually the concentration and deformation of the rivers and lakes. Since there are many risks on the rivers and lakes, nature needs to be protected. This is why the heroes of the rivers and lakes have shown their talents. The dangers and catastrophes encountered by Tang Yin and his party in Journey to the West are roughly divided into two categories: one is the robbery of the demon. This constitutes the main content of the westbound; the other is that Sun Wukong is brave and brave, taking the initiative to capture and surrender the demon, which is not directly related to the study, but it is the true character of the rivers and lakes. These are just common in public novels.A replica of the rivers and lakes, such as Lu Zhishenâ€™s hustle and bustle in Taohua Village and Sun Wukongâ€™s Gao Laozhuangâ€™s fall of the Pig Eight Rings. However, Sun Wukongâ€™s character image has gained the power of sublimation and transcendence from the citizen literature. His lofty historical mission has made Sun Wukong an unusual hero, and the weakness of urban hooligans has almost drowned those who are arrogant. Hero character, they lack the call and spiritual pursuit of a more noble life mission. The hero always has to withstand the test. The trip to the West is a test of history. The humorous and playful attitude of Sun Wukong and the savvy nature of the contingency make him seem to care about everything, and he can always save his life. It will be easy to handle all serious tests. The special feature of Journey to the West is that Sun Wukong is ultimately a winner. However, on the westbound road, Sun Wukong&#39;s conversion to Buddhism was only one reason for his trip to the West. He was not really subject to the Buddhist beliefs and precepts. In addition, for the family style of Buddhism, Sun Wukong also has a lot of ridicule, and he has no respect for the Buddha&#39;s sage. He is not a Buddhist. However, Sun Wukongâ€™s trip to the West was not forced. The curse did not play the role of forcing Sun Wukongâ€™s westward journey on the westbound journey. Instead, it maintained the dignity and authority of Tang Yan, and the curse gave Tang Yan a mysterious power. Among the four men and women who were forced to go west is the Pig Eight Rings. The reason why he was able to persevere is that most of them are because of Sun Wukongâ€™s bondage to him and Sun Wukongâ€™s ruin, and the extraordinary power of life. When Sun Wukong was crushed under the Five Elements Mountain, what he longed for was the opportunity to show his talents again, and the arrival of Tang Yan gave him such an opportunity. Many of the most comedy stories in Journey to the West often occur between Sun Wukong and the Pig Eight Rings. If Sun Wukong is the protagonist, the Pig Eight Rings is his important supporting role. The prototype of the Pig Eight Rings is from the countryside, and the prototype of Sun Wukong is from the city. The folk art is often used to tease the country. In fact, there is no fundamental conflict between the two. Sun Wukong is only happy to take the pig. Do some pranks. As early as the book of Journey to the West, the story of the Western Heavens was once put on the stage. The Jinyuan has &quot;Tang Sanzang&quot;, Wu Changling in the early Yuan Dynasty, &quot;Tang Sanzang Xitian Jingjing&quot;, Yang Jingxian in the late Yuan Dynasty and the early Ming Dynasty, and &quot;Journey to the West&quot; are still circulating. Some of the elements of these operas may therefore have an impact and leave traces in the formation of Journey to the West. For example, Journey to the WestEvery time in the catastrophe, it is a self-contained situation, and there is a climax at the beginning and the end. It can be easily adapted into a drama. &quot;Journey to the West&quot; shows the stories that have happened in some animal worlds. The gods and devils that have been written except the corpse are almost always made of animal essence. This is like the Monkey Mountain and Lion Rock in the zoo. Aquariums and insect museums have naturally become a favorite playground for children. In Journey to the West, these animal images often retain their own characteristics and habits, showing children&#39;s strong interest in the animal world, meticulous observation and lively imagination. Therefore, everyone has also been brought into the innocent fairy tale world, Sun Wukong as the protagonist, its dynamic and uneasy characteristics are also in line with the child&#39;s nature, with the monkey as the main character, just to meet the child&#39;s active psychology. &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is also a novel that is loved by children, which contains rich fairy tale factors. To be honest, because I don&#39;t have a deep understanding of the original work, Mr. Lin&#39;s book is just a sneak peek. I didn&#39;t deeply understand the deep meaning of it, but I have learned a lot of knowledge and I am very satisfied. Continue to watch the books of everyone&#39;s small books.",movie

901,"With the &quot;Sunset Car God&quot;, the new director Nicholas, who made a new film last year, &quot;The Only God can forgive&quot; appeared in Cannes, commenting on the two extremes. In this new film, the story is weakened, the violent bloodyness is doubled, and the audience is called â€œonly God can understandâ€. In general, this black movie full of metaphors cannot repeat the â€œSunset Car Godâ€. A myth. In one sentence, the street in Bangkok under the night sky is described as &quot;the street is darker than the night.&quot; The whimsical electric sound, the color is between the rich and the suffocating red and the blue of the ice The change made the Bangkok under the lens emit a dangerous atmosphere. Extremely violent criminals, showcase women&#39;s business, and are keen on violent police chiefs. The content of the story can be summed up in one sentence: the drug traffickers who raped and killed the youngsters were killed by the police in a violent way. After the gangâ€™s motherâ€™s revenge, she was killed by the police. The narrative is extremely weak, the characters are slow, and the lines are ambiguous. It only relies on the picture to prop up the whole movie. The metaphor is constant and it is different from the melodrama. It is more like a short, sharp and sharp poem. The theme that this movie can&#39;t surround is the Oedipus complex. Ryan Gosling&#39;s protagonist Julian, immersed in the &quot;father&#39;s love&quot;, because of his uncle, so fled from the United States to Bangkok. He is immersed in his uncle&#39;s lyrical feelings, seeing his mother as a taboo desire that he never gets, and suffering from passion and possessiveness. The metaphor of the hands is no longer obvious, symbolizing the source of the penis and sin. Therefore, when he had a relationship with a woman, Julian always had the illusion that his hands were cut, indicating that the desire in his eyes was taboo, the fruit of sin, the crime that must be tried, and why? Because his initial desire points to the mother, a sinful thought that cannot be redeemed and washed away. When Julian washed his hands, the illusion of sewage suddenly appeared, which further implied that the desire in his eyes was an extremely dirty sin. Killing his father can&#39;t fulfill his desire to have a mother. His brother is more competitive than himself. So after his brother died, Julian&#39;s revenge is not enough. In fact, he implies that he does not want revenge. He is deserving of his brother&#39;s sin, both as a rape and a murder. Refers to the exclusive mother. Let me talk about the role of the mother, using their son&#39;s attachment to their own control. It can be seen from the mother&#39;s embarrassing actions on the son that their relationship is extraordinary. After the mother was killed, Julian put her hands into her mother&#39;s stomach.This is a typical maternal and child attachment complex: at this time he wants to be a soft baby, returning to the original warm uterus and returning to the mother&#39;s body. Uncle and aunt, Julian feels guilty and takes the initiative to choose to break this sinful hand. Uncle, who plays the head of the police, holds a long knife and cuts off the hand of the sinful person at any time. The knife symbolizes the blade of judgment, and the uncle is the order defender under the concept of patriarchy, and he is in charge of the &quot;God&quot; of justice. .",movie

The manâ€™s husband, speaking and speaking, speaks a lot. This morning, I decided to use a few Guevara coupons to quickly use them, and suddenly felt that my quality of life has improved by a grade. The sci-fi elements that this yearâ€™s heroes have hard to break into are really full of slots. The treasure of the town of the dark forces, do not say do not know, said it scared. When the name of this thing was read from the mouth of the opening narration, I almost got used to sitting in the theater seat and almost fell off the seat. To! too! I donâ€™t know how to be copied from the scriptwriter. I can only go to the big screen. I can only say that the physics of the scriptwriter is taught by the physical education teacher. There is no other explanation. The theory assumes that it is colorless, odorless, non-toxic and pollution-free. Later, the experiment was jointly performed by Michelson and Morley to prove that the thing that did not exist at all became the general existence of the ring of Sauron. In the modern physics lab, Brother once cursed &quot;å“”?? Civilized language?? Mao laser&quot; with his friends, and relied on the table to get experimental data and personally verified the same fact. Seriously advise the scriptwriters, and then make a slap in the face, please keep up with the times. In this film, what is called Higgs to harm the sentient beings is better than the ether. At least this product has won a dynamite award this year. The goddess Jane and a group of children found high technology in an abandoned building.

One shot, the date of the appointment, is clearly Roy, one of the two neurotic creatures in IT Crowd. Waiting for the mouth is like hearing &quot;Have you tried turning it off and on again?&quot; However, when I saw Roy, I still felt positive energy. After all, I saw that the small probability of the goddess of silk may still happen. To get through the interplanetary mobile phone, no technology is obviously not enough. To do this, you really have to rely on geek like Roy to complete the task of saving the world. The meta-material cloaking technique is confusing in the Dark Elves&#39; spaceship.

After reading the guest appearance of Kat Dennings in this film, I am even more convinced that she is a true performance in the broke sisters. In addition to starting to smash an ugly stone man, this film of the elder brother did not turn over other people. Loki sent the Buddha to the West Heaven&#39;s blind eye method, and the brothers flew the ball one meter in front of the door, and the hammer went down like the same.

903,"Satire humanity, sarcasm or politics, the film to grasp these two points to do the core of the theme means deep. This is a very easy way, and it is also a technique that tests the level of the director. I don&#39;t know how many directors choose to make political films for the upper ranks, and how many actors are happy to participate. However, there are many similar types, and the comparability and selectivity are also strong. Good or bad can immediately see the real chapter at the moment of the movie. In 2009, Neil Blomkamp, â€‹â€‹a well-known South African director of the long film debut &quot;The 9th District&quot;, will return to the cinema with his new work &quot;The Bliss Space&quot; and will surely receive the promise. This sharp young man who is good at telling sci-fi stories, observes the society from a unique perspective, and has won the box office and word-of-mouth achievements in the spirit of challenging the sensitive subject with the spirit of the newborn calf. The small world pattern of &quot;The Ninth District&quot; now seems to be reminiscent. In fact, there is no shortage of good films in the current movie market. What is lacking is a good film with personality. For Neil Blomkamp, â€‹â€‹too much personality makes him inevitably successful. However, it will also bring him a short-lived crisis. The starting point is too high and it is difficult to overtake. In particular, the thickness of the film kernel is a risk that is difficult to circumvent the subject matter of differentiation. Shooting &quot;The Musical Space&quot;, the director chose the theme and content of the continuation of self-style, just magnified the pattern, and then used the star to increase the selling point of the film, expecting to raise a height from the &quot;hardware&quot;, so that the texture of the film is not lower than its own design. Set the steps. This is a conservative approach and will not make the film unreliable. The only place where there is a crisis is whether the falling point of the story can hold the set pattern, and the picture that seems to have been acquainted will not be fresh. It must be admitted that the directorâ€™s four years of silence have not completely disappeared. The plot of the hour before the work was tempered to be quite skillful, with no obvious bruises, and the details were polished. If you want to say the shortcomings, the story is still old-fashioned. Despite the different styles, there are always some shadows similar to the film, and no updated ideas are given. Such a design will have a problem with the past, and if other aspects cannot be complemented, the work can only flow in the ordinary. Fortunately, the director of the technology is doing a lot, although it is a virtual confrontation, but the reality of the picture is no less than the realist theme. In the &quot;Zen District&quot;, Neil Blomkamp has shown his talents in special effects, making the realism of science fiction films particularly convincing. But the biggest problem comes from the last 50 minutes, the protagonist finally began to resist the part of the rhythm to become mixedChaos, the plot also tends to get out of control. The lonely hero that he thought was still a fear of death, selfishness, and no bears and wisdom; he thought that it was a revolution in class struggle, but it was actually a few black heartbreakers. Even the final sacrifice of the male No. 1 has a strong anti-smuggling color. At the beginning of the film, the director clearly pointed out that there is no simple justice hero in the character. The male one is not the consciousness of the savior from the beginning. He was the revolutionary leader in the end, and it was just the result of a coincidence and a forced collision. If you follow the &quot;Black Mirror&quot; routine, this idea will be more speculative. The protagonist debut is a slavish once-inspired legend. The latter half becomes a complete slave or reverses into a pure hero. It will make the four years of imprisonment become alive and fascinating. Regrettably, this character does not give force. He always hesitates between black and white. He has never seen the &quot;female girl&quot; in the market, and his partner is more energetic. The loss of an actor in this work is hard to say whether it is a director, a screenwriter, or their own responsibility. However, the performance of the male No. 1 in the film should indeed make it difficult for his people. Matt Damonâ€™s sluggish eyes, seemingly thick and solid, have some soft builds that will not let the audience question how the worker who was seriously exposed to nuclear radiation lasted. In the end of his last sacrifice, there was no radiation side effect. Impact? Another protagonist of the film, Judy Foster&#39;s senior black-hearted politician and politician, whose character design is too flat, is a waste of Judy&#39;s deductive talent. As for the IQ of the character itself, there will be no big mistakes, but the quality of the relative role should be too low. Neil Blomkamp is ambitious about this work, otherwise he will not choose from the storyline to the movie. My actors are all close to the country. However, when utilitarianism is mixed in enthusiasm, it often makes the texture of the work no longer pure. A variety of problems have also emerged one after another, becoming the creator of the creator. Not only is there such a problem in &quot;The Musical Space&quot;, but it is the same in other movies. In these repetitions of success and failure, we can see the unchangeability of laws and principles. If the new creators of the high-end circle want to continue successfully and not let their virgins compare, they will only gradually precipitate themselves and make the works more pure. It is difficult to create a unique and unique work based on commercialization.",movie
904,"The film actually tells us the conclusion of a two-word: reincarnation. A well-known word, but no one can confirm its existence or not, can only choose whether to believe it, more is to choose to ignore it. The film borrows the word back to us and we are related to everyone in the world, thus admonishing people to do good, and each change of relationship will affect their existence in the future. This is actually a very new theory, I prefer to call it, and I still believe it. The existence of this world is a network. Everyone has a lot of root lines connected to many other people or things. It is true that the whole body is established. But if this kind of statement is reincarnation, I feel too divine, and it is difficult to understand accurately. If it does, I don&#39;t know what my past life was like. If I believe that there is reincarnation, since I donâ€™t know what my past life was like, then my future generations will not know what my life is like, I donâ€™t know, I wonâ€™t perceive it, then I still care about it. Will it affect future generations? I don&#39;t know the last life, how many people will take care of his next life? Of course, although the movie plot does not explicitly say that the people in different time and space are the same person, he actually expresses the meaning of reincarnation. In addition to the reincarnation, the film also presents many other things, such as beliefs, beliefs, homosexuality, music, weak food, and fear of power. Such a big movie contains too many things. There are still a lot of things that can&#39;t be digested, especially many cultural-related things. Although I donâ€™t think it is enough, I donâ€™t want to read it a few more times. Even if I really want to know more, I will choose to read the novel.",movie
905,"Any movie, as long as the name of Lin Zhiling appears on the cast, the audience may have a complex feeling in mind. The admiration of the perfect body of the goddess is intertwined with the suspicion of the quality of the film, often to the door of the theater with trepidation. Especially in June, &quot;Fuchun&quot; caused the people to spit out, and now, whenever it resounds, there is still a lingering fear. This will inevitably affect people&#39;s prejudgment of &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot;, which is difficult to be cherished, but in fact this film was completed last year and premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival, which received a good response. Compared to the popular love scenes and the love bridges in the action blockbuster, &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; encapsulates a pure and romantic love story with a delicate picture, returning to the style of pure love. However, the highlight of this style does not seem to have much to do with Chinese movies, but the transnational expression of Japanese small fresh love films. Director Shinohara Sugawara is a Japanese Mesozoic director who is very good at love. His works &quot;Love at the other end of the sky&quot;, &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;Paradise Book House&quot;, etc., are not known for their romantic beauty, and often put emotions in the vortex of time. In the middle, the thing between the memory and the future is smashed, and the faintness of the light makeup is rendered. In terms of actors, the Japanese rough-fashioned handsome Chiuchibo and the refreshing-type handsome man Fusuke Yusuke are the protagonists of the Love Doubles. Whether they are selling in the girl, or playing cool in the secret, they are familiar with the eyebrows. Even Lin Chi-ling, who is a Chinese, has a cute temperament of Japanese girls in the style, costumes and performances in the film. Reminiscent of her age and identity, this picture is easy to play, but not to be enchanted. The film story is a typical love triangle love. Two men fell in love with Lin Yue (Lin Chi-ling) who was studying in Japan at the same time. However, the wood field (Hirochichi) is a bit sloppy, and the emotion is deeply hidden in the bottom of the heart, while Ah Shou (Fukui Yusuke) ) But decisive attack, bold love, and soon fell in love with Lin Yue. However, Ah Shou left the world because of a forest disaster in a snowstorm, and this love began to fall into shackles. Lin Yue can&#39;t forget the feelings of the Guardian, and the wood field that is resolutely guarding her can only wait for a long time, alone in the sadness of his heart. In a flashback manner, the film inserts the story of the three people who were in Hokkaido ten years ago in the story of the woodyard and Linyue after ten years. However, the death of injury and illness as a turning point in the love story seems to be unconventional, and after the accident of the Guardian, a forest sorrow was spread.In the festival, the romantic atmosphere in the first half of the film was quickly transferred into the trap of the dog blood drama, which weakened the appeal of the film&#39;s emotions. The unique feature of &quot;Sweet Chocolate&quot; is that it avoids the conflict of drama in the triangle love narrative, but deals with the emotional entanglement between them with the delicate techniques of the loose culture. The contradiction between the three is not the contradiction of the incident, but the contradiction of the character&#39;s character in determining the manner of behavior. The depth of the wood field, the brightness of the Guardian, and the steadfastness of Lin Yue, each of them acted in accordance with their own principles, and the result was that love became confusing. Lin Yue did not accept the wood field for a long time, not only because Ah Shou occupied all the positions in her heart, but because she had not found the shadow of the original love from the wood field. Until she was ill, the wood yard held her hand and guarded her. The warmth she felt made her see the signal that love was coming again. Then, when the wood field also made the taste of the chocolate made by the former A Shou, the two men in Lin Yueâ€™s life were completely coincident. Corresponding to the topic, chocolate plays an important role in the film narrative. Lin Yue and A Shou&#39;s love affair started with them to send chocolates to the villagers. After the death of Ah Shou, Lin Yue came to Shanghai to open a chocolate shop. The dream of A Shousheng was also a way of commemorating him. In order to catch up with Lin Yue, the wood field also made chocolates in his own home. The existence of chocolate is a series of clues between characters, which become the symbol of the various narrative nodes in the film when it is time and space. At the same time, the film&#39;s chocolate making process and chocolate beans that seem to be full of color and fragrance give the audience a strong taste on the screen. In terms of cultural extension, Ah Shouâ€™s sending neighbors Song Chocolate and Lin Yue to send chocolate to the old peopleâ€™s homes showed a beautiful picture of Utopia. Everyone is a good person and a representative of both big love and small love. In the depths of the story, rather than the tension of the film exists between the expression and acceptance of the character&#39;s emotions, it is said that it is a race of love and time. The function of time is that it will make a lot of things blur, and it will make a lot of things clearer. Who can win the time to hone, who can get the taste after the emotional brewing. Ten years of time, not only proved the infatuation of the wood field, but also made Lin Yue out of the haze caused by the death of the lover. Under the sculpting of the double-sided knives of time, the appearance of love is also vivid. In reality, when the reporter asked Lin Chi-ling, someone is chasing you recently. She said that no one chased me, it was time to chase me. This classic answer, with the film storyThere is a good match, time flies with beauty, and where is love? As a kind of moving image, the film first faces the audience, and the form it presents will directly affect the viewing experience. &quot;Sweetheart Chocolate&quot; is a scene across the tourist attraction of Hokkaido, Japan, and the gorgeous city of Shanghai. With a rich oil painting, the quiet scenery of Yubari and the night view of the Bund are built on the screen to create a beautiful Fairytale world. The white snow covered with the earth, the quietly standing bell tower, the forest road after the rain, the oriental pearl outside the glass window, and the bar of light and shadow, form a distinctive contrast between the country and the city. At the same time, the music of Hisaishi&#39;s music changes with the mood of the protagonist. It is the melody style that we are familiar with. Together with the picture, it decorates the frame of this beautiful story.",movie
906,"Undercover police films have always been the leader of the type theme, blood is not terrible, terrible is unpredictable. The emergence of Han Ying&#39;s &quot;New World&quot; has made people seem to have a new view on &quot;undercover&quot;. The film does not ignore the status quo of undercover, nothing more than the sagacity of undercover people. Man-made knives, my end for the fish is not the shrinking life of the undercover people, the king wants to die, the old Huang Li who has to die has also turned over. The film seems to break through the limitations of the undercover theme, but to establish the police in a more neutral position. The police&#39;s actions have meaning, but not all undercovers must be swallowed up. South Korean acting school Cui Yuzhi still shaped a more complicated and awkward police image of Chief Jiang. In order to control and master the criminal activities within the gangster industry Golden Gate Group, a number of police undercover Golden Gate Group were dispatched. The undercover person chosen by the South Korean police is very interesting. For example, Li Zicheng used to be a little punk on the street. He once killed a lot of people with his friend Ding Qing (of course, these are all at the end of the film), so I can see Jiang Kechang choose Li Zicheng undercover. The purpose of Li Zicheng&#39;s successful completion of the task did not return to the police station, but was continuously entrusted with a heavy responsibility. The police actually have such a speculative intention. Undercovers used to be Xiaotaibao or Xiaotaimei. They are not easy to be suspected, and they all have the courage to fight alone. Although the Golden Gate Group is a black nest, Li Zicheng and his The Go Master is easy to break into the group. In the end, Mr. Jiangâ€™s first-class death was much more sinful. Of course, Li Zicheng did not want to be one of many innocent victims to save himself. The plot setting of the film is very complicated, but it is still a mutual game between the interests of the police and the Golden Gate Group. The Kinmen Group has always been a constant struggle. It is said that it is a struggle of interests. Because who can sit on the position of president, it must be a martial arts or a private pocket. . From the beginning of the film, it was full of raging killings, and the level of bloody violence climbed all the way. The death of Cui Lizhi showed the evil and embarrassment of Li Zicheng, and the car accident of Chairman Shi was actually the conspiracy of Li Zhongjiu. Of course, the police did not sit idly by, so the conflict between Li Zhongjiu and Ding Qing was aggravated, and Ding Qing was finally removed. Zhang Shouji, who supported it, had to kill Li Zicheng, and Li Zicheng slammed the door and thoroughly cleaned up the portal, so that he could sit firmly in the position of president. Such an intricate relationship is actually a game where I have no you, the fittest survives, and Li Zicheng is a superficial Sven guy, but the heart is full of blazing flames. At the beginning of man, sex is good. Li Zichengâ€™s work is not a one-off, but a difficult life.Save the selection. Apparently he escaped the strange circle for the position of president, and far away from other people. Conversely, Li Zicheng interprets too much brotherhood from Ding Qing, so his success may be able to comfort the underground Ding Qing. Since 2002, there have been few wonderful &quot;undercover&quot; police films, and the emergence of Han Ying&#39;s &quot;New World&quot;, novel ideas, violence and bloodthirsty lens, is amazing. The film is clear and the actors perform real and moving. Of course, this movie full of male hormones is more basic, not only to let people see more blood and ruthless reality. Li Zicheng&#39;s forced force on Liangshan is more forced than helplessness. One can&#39;t protect himself. Living may be like a corpse and a beast. Li Zicheng&#39;s revelation is more of a self-scream and complaint. Of course, the film is not the same as &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; is still the victory of the main theme, although there are also wits and courage, but compared with &quot;New World&quot;, the former is obviously somewhat tempered and deceitful, and the latter is more thorough and realistic. Perhaps Li Zicheng&#39;s longing is also a brand new world. Here only he has the final say, not to be the embarrassment of others, to be a true self, probably this is also the true meaning of the film. Although &quot;New World&quot; is a commercial production, it is even more unforgettable that the film is a delicate narrative technique. The plot is interlocking, the psychological changes in the role are well-founded, and the violence is bloody. It is a rare police film. (published in Beiqing Daily)",movie

The combination of the two traits produces a chemical reaction that makes each story even more exciting, with more expressiveness and more possibilities. At the same time, the storyline influences the shaping of the characters because of the gain effect of the style. The character shaping in a specific environment-specific atmosphere is relatively simpler and more vivid. The illusion of &quot;illusion&quot; allows people to shape without being constrained by the real world, and can better exert the author&#39;s imagination; while &quot;ke&quot; plays a vital role in the characterization of the human level, not only limited to the so-called &quot;Rational&quot; highlights the depth of its content, such as &quot;Fantasy Love Capsule&quot; in &quot;Rose of Yesterday&quot;, such as &quot;Sedative&quot; in &quot;Real Look&quot;; &quot;Odd&quot; has more on the basis of the section. The weird changes have added &quot;Wings&quot; to the wings that can fly. The combination of &quot;magic&quot; + &quot;ke&quot; + &quot;odd&quot; is the unique feature of the author, and combining this feature well and playing well is the foundation for the formation of excellent story texts. From this point of view, the author&#39;s ability to build a story system based on his own characteristics is excellent, grasping the rhythm, shaping the characters, and conveying his own ideas, etc., is also very good. This kind of excellence gives people a feeling of being in a illusion and still in a dream. This kind of excellence gives people an unrealistic but really true sense of violation. Like a mental illness, it looks like a genius, looks like Crazy, seemingly reasonable, seemingly ridiculous... these feelings are intertwined, making readers feel nothing about the story and the characters in the story.Often deep, even if it is clear that the story is fake, and can not help but feel empathy, even if the scene is fictional, and can not help but feel like being there. This is the author&#39;s ability to stand out. If the author overcomes some of the flaws in the work and can continue to explode his imagination based on his own style, then the author&#39;s future is limitless.",movie
909,"Blurred night, girl, red lips. It was such a poster that attracted me. After watching the movie and going to the director, I found out that it was Abbas&#39;s work. It was completely unexpected to me but I thought about the whole movie&#39;s layout. This &quot;Mou Love River&quot; was invested by France, and Iranian Abbas was the director and the Japanese actor in the whole class. Impression of Abbas: &quot;Growing and Growing&quot; &quot;Where is my friend&#39;s house&quot;, &quot;The taste of cherry&quot;, &quot;White balloon&quot;... He is good at revealing the deepest emotions of human beings from ordinary events. His films have their own unique style, simple language and profound ideas. Itâ€™s unexpected to say that this theme is not the kind of â€œnativeâ€ movie in the past (sorry I only saw Abbasâ€™s early classics), but itâ€™s unexpected because Abbasâ€™s quiet shot puts people Deeply substituted into the character&#39;s emotions and embarrassing situation. The film came to an abrupt end in the climax. The subtitles in the broken glass sound give people unlimited imagination. This is a simple story, a story that takes place within 24 hours, relies on the help of a girl who earns money to study in the field, a grumpy, caring boyfriend, and a retired university professor. The intersection of the three protagonists is carried out on the character&#39;s behavior and role hypothesis... The role of substitution is also true. The professor chose the girl&#39;s service because she missed her deceased wife. The girl took a circle on the taxi, just to see her grandmother, but she didn&#39;t dare to meet her personally; her boyfriend was very annoyed at the friend&#39;s news, he was very Love girls is very inferior. From the beginning of the conversation, the girl said that she is like a professor&#39;s wife, and the professor looked at the sleeping girl, and could not help but embark on the elder&#39;s love for the child. On the following day, the professor was mistaken by his boyfriend as the grandfather of the girl. The professor was undecided and would be wrong. Until the event was revealed, the girl was beaten and the professor took her home but was chased downstairs by her boyfriend. The sword is arrogant, and the girl is shivering with her head, and her boyfriend is a violent shot. The professor was in a mess in the room until a sudden loud noise, the glass was smashed, and the movie ended. What happened later. Boyfriend rushed upstairs to fight for the big man? Girl desperate for mercy? Does the professorâ€™s interpretation work? The contradiction of the whole movie is ultimately derived from the emptiness and loneliness of modern people&#39;s life. Girls need to be assisted in life and study, so that they can alienate their family members. The boyfriend knows that the girl has done such a thing, she is afraid that she will betray herself, Professor She has been living alone, her husband has passed away, and her children have never cared about him. Everyone is in the lightThe strange world is difficult to move forward, and some forks can make some people meet in a narrow way, and some forks let some people part ways. Such as Mu Aihe, the name of the movie is actually quite acne. It is obviously not the love in the traditional sense. It is just a trace of humanity in the warmth and warmth of human sentiment. It is impossible to talk about such deep feelings. No matter where the background of the story is, the bones are the same.",movie

912,"The film tells the story of a woman from discovering love, losing love, finding love, and finally discovering that love is around. The director uses the beautiful and smooth lens to create a moving story environment from Hokkaido to Shanghai. The director of the film is Japanese. From each shot of the film, the Japanese are almost harsh on the lens. The large-scale vision lens shows the beauty of the character, plus the sweetness of Lin Chi-ling and the two handsome Japanese actors. The collocation makes the whole story full of surprises like chocolate. The film is divided into two urban spaces: Shanghai and Japan. Most of the scenes in Japan are the fragments recalled by the heroine Lin Yue, and Shanghai is the reality of life scenes. The two are interspersed with the memories of the protagonist Lin Yue, and the stories of the past ten years and the present are told. The theme is very clear, that is, to get love, wait for love, wait for love, to the perfect ending. It can be said that the film changed the heroine&#39;s death for the loyal love in most love films, no longer stand up to the chaste, seek new love, forget the old love. Japan&#39;s geospatial space and Shanghai&#39;s urban space present a different atmosphere. For the Japanese space where the reminiscences appear, the director perfects the story 10 years ago with a very beautiful composition. There is no quarrel, no separation, but only The accidental death of Hoshino Shou made the film a faint helplessness; in the urban space of Shanghai, the director abandoned the aesthetic composition and presented the story of the story with different memories in a more realistic lens language. As a result, the level of the film is very clear, so that the audience can jump from reality to memories, and then jump from memory to reality, the film also carried out a good narrative work in such a reciprocating way. From the color point of view, we can also see the clues, more of the color of the urban space used in Japan, the setting of the series of scenes of snow mountains and flowers, making the film&#39;s memory fragments as dreamlike, unrealistic; In the real scenes of Shanghai, more is to show a more realistic life scene, whether it is an exhibition, a bar, or a &quot;sweet chocolate&quot; shop. For example, in a sweetheart chocolate shop that was originally full of dreams, one of the consumers and students of a shop said, â€œHow can chocolate have feelings?â€ In fact, this paragraph has undoubtedly aggravated a â€œrealâ€ environment in todayâ€™s society. Construction, urban Shanghai in the baptism of consumer culture, the relationship between people has become difficult to maintain, and really do things with loveThere are very few people who feel, just like making chocolate, chocolate with emotions and chocolate finished with blind mechanization, becoming two manifestations of feelings in today&#39;s society. &quot;Sweetheart Chocolate&quot; is derived from the heroine of the film. The star of the singer, Hoshino, plays the sweetheart chocolate in front of each household on the New Year&#39;s Eve every year. The heroine is the good place of the actor. Impressed, and after the actor died in an accident, he vowed to become his nameless &quot;wife.&quot; From the beginning to the end of the film, the man in the memory did not take the initiative to &quot;kiss&quot; and other actions with Lin Yue, even Lin Yue fell off the mountain due to accident, no artificial respiration, just on the Ferris wheel, male For the first time, the protagonist took the hand of Lin Yue and let her feel the heartbeat. The film reflects a very &quot;pure&quot; concept of love, and it can be said that it will be said to &quot;express the feelings of the ceremony&quot; to the extreme. On the other hand, going back to the real passages, every time Iâ€™ve been waiting for Linâ€™s ten-year-old Ichiro Ichiro (played by Ikeiâ€™s play), the attack on love is more direct, and often because of â€œmemoryâ€, and finally, and finally At the end of the film, he sent out his own voice and held the beauty. The film can be seen from here, the director is telling us that in the face of love, blind waiting does not necessarily lead to a perfect result, take the initiative to attack, love is at your fingertips. The film director tried to use such a love story that spanned ten years to express the emotional state of the contemporary people and express a more direct view of love. As a must-have dessert for love, chocolate has added a sweet love to the film on November 11th. However, the film wants to create a box office miracle similar to &quot;Lovelorn 33 Days&quot; by the Singles Day schedule, which seems to be unrealistic. Lin Chi-lingâ€™s acting needs to be improved. The performance of the two Japanese actor is too exaggerated. At the same time, the transition from Japanese to Chinese has made Lin Chi-lingâ€™s voice have a certain possibility. Itâ€™s not awkward, but when it comes to Chinese, itâ€™s still the same. In the end, the whole story is still a bit old-fashioned. In order to miss the past, he will not hesitate to sacrifice the waiting of the perfect infatuated man until he is moved by this man and gain happiness. There aren&#39;t too many clips that need emotional rendering throughout the movie, and crying can solve all the problems. The last part of the film, Lin Yue, said that everyoneâ€™s love has their own taste, too preaching. And the heroine grew up from a girl to a woman in ten years.People, this typical idol drama style, did not go beyond the drama of the past.

915,"Barbara, who is close to retirement age, is alone, teaching history in a middle school. For decades, she has been polite and even established a very close relationship with some people. Others trust and respect Barbara, chatting with her, perhaps inadvertently revealing the most unknown secrets, naughty students will see her deep and dignified face will sit down, even if they have already finished class. But Barbara is eager to be close and deliberately alienated from others. She records the secrets of others day after day. She has nothing but the diary and the cat who is as old as her. She carefully maintains her harmony and authority with a calm and unpredictable attitude. Barbara&#39;s alienation from the crowd, from the beginning of the film, injects mystery into the story. Normal people are not so contradictory between intimacy and alienation. Normal people can easily trust her and tell her the secret easily, but she can&#39;t trust the group. There must be too many &quot;allergies&quot; and &quot;abnormalities&quot; in her body that deviate from the group. Barbaraâ€™s life has not changed much until a new young art teacher, Hiba, came to school. She is young and beautiful, with an elegant temperament. Shebaâ€™s husband is a lot older than her, and her adolescent daughter is beautifully rebellious. In addition, she has a born stupid son. The arrival of Shiba has aroused the attention of Barbara, who secretly cares about everything about Shiba. So when the students could not resolve the conflict, Barbara appeared, successfully managed to use everything to calm down everything, and instinctively squeezed out the secrets of students&#39; sexual fantasies about Hibba. In this way, Barbara and Shiba became good friends, and Hibba Barbara chatted and ate, invited her to go to the house to be a guest, and inadvertently said that she did not think about other people. Barbaraâ€™s feelings for Shiba are getting deeper and deeper, and there seems to be a point of dependence in life, until one night Barbara finds Shiba through the window to sneak with the students. Hibba begged Barbara to wait until after Christmas to tell the principal about the secret and hope to finish the Christmas. Unexpectedly, Barbara decided not to expose. Since then, Barbara&#39;s attachment to Shiba has begun to increase, and she has been going to Xiba more and more times. At the same time, she has recorded or fantasized about Shiba. After the incident, Xiba carefully and with Barbara, trying to meet all her requirements, but she decisively refused Barbara&#39;s request to touch the arm. On the other hand, she and the students are still smashed, keeping the ground and feeling discovered by Barbara. In the days of keeping secrets, Barbara is immersed in an unprecedentedIn sweetness and happiness, she is sure that Hibba is her true companion. One day, Barbara&#39;s cat was going to have an injection-type death. When she was sad, she asked Hiba to accompany her to the veterinarian, but Hibba had to go to see her son and perform. Barbara felt that her trust and loyalty to her friendship had been challenged and betrayed, and she was resentful and told the secret of Hibba to Brian. Brian secretly loves Hiba and looks for Barbara to inquire about the news. Barbara tells Brian about the unhappiness of Hiba and the students, and adds fuel to the fact that Hiba does not like Brian, who is old and lacking in charm. Brian will secretly make it public, and the world of Hibba collapses instantly. Her husband&#39;s anger, her daughter&#39;s jealousy and the media&#39;s pursuit of Hiba&#39;s heart and soul, finally decided to move to Barbara&#39;s home to take refuge. Barbara is very satisfied with all this. She escorted Hibba through the surging journalists, and Sheba enjoys the world of two people she built, and is deeply immersed in happiness and fantasy. It was not until Hibba turned out Barbara&#39;s diary, saw everything recorded inside, vicious words, illusions of nothing, possession of secret ecstasy. In the end, Hiba found that Barbara was gay and understood why Barbara&#39;s former friend Jennifer would leave Barbara and she chose to go home. Only Barbara sat on the bench of the past and spoke to the young girl, as if she was continuing to create and find the next Jennifer and Heba. The movie of 2007, this is relatively new in the movie that was saved. The beginning of the teacher and student situation will inevitably make people think of &quot;classroom love&quot;, thinking that it is a love between a beautiful female teacher and a young male student. But in the movie, Barbara&#39;s voice is too strong, and the inner monologue is throughout the film and must be the focus of the film. Barbara&#39;s fascination with the secret lies in his own possessive desire to occupy the secret master by occupying the secret itself. Her inner possessive and authoritative image is rooted in the isolation and isolation of the individual. Her lesbian identity separates her from the patriarchal and female groups. There is no doubt that this is a female movie. The physical relationship between Shiba and the students is caused by women&#39;s inability to withstand social pressures and unable to resolve their inner burdens. Shiba, like every woman, needs to face pressure from her husband and children at home, to play the role of a good teacher, and the role of a woman recognized by this society. In addition to coping with the bullying from the patriarchal society, Barbara also has to endure the contempt of the female group, so she puts all the distorted emotions into the diary and that one.Cat. When the people around me inadvertently asked about Jennifer&#39;s situation, she was careful, saying that she had transferred to a primary school. I don&#39;t know Jennifer was driven crazy by her to go to a mental hospital. Here, the film involves more than just the story of teacher-student love, and pay more attention to the construction of female identity. How should women define their social roles and what should they do in the face of confusion and temptation? What should women do when they face sexual harassment from the female group itself? These problems are only a little bit of water in the movie, and they have not been carried out in depth. Jenniferâ€™s mental illness suggests womenâ€™s incomprehension of lesbians and fear of women themselves. Perhaps at the end of the day, when Hibba returned to her husband&#39;s arms, women saw a little hope. Long live the understanding. Compared with the despicableness that Brian wants to destroy, Hibbaâ€™s husband is angry with Hibbaâ€™s extramarital affairs, but it is also reasonable. After all, Hibba is unfaithful. When Hiba moved to Barbara&#39;s home, he showed understanding and tolerance, and finally he was willing to re-admit Hebba. He did not give up his feelings with Hibba because of his infidelity. Barbaraâ€™s mistake is that she is willing to add emotion to others and burden others. Threats and intimidation of these incorrect or unhealthy emotions, once exploited, can only lead to destruction. Of course, the distortion of her personality was imposed on her by the whole society. She became a victim of a particular historical period. 2013/11/12 9:00 pm, at Nanhu",movie

In the film, Poor bangs&#39;s male No. 2 Yingdao has become the only candidate to set this difficulty. It can be seen that he threatens and bullies the heroine again and again (of course our audience knows that this is a manifestation of his childish love. And many women are happy to see this kind of bullying scene. I will simply say this below.) The result has given Lee Min Ho time and again &quot;the need to play&quot;, deepening the audience&#39;s romantic sense of substitution?? Oh, I Prince, come and save me this woman? In addition, Korean drama has always been abstinence, and getting along for one night does not imply that anything has happened. It takes a long time to hold hands and sway to the corner of a certain kind of thing. A good night kiss on the forehead is a shudder, though Abstinence, but in fact constitutes a full of high-spirited tensions of passion, it can be said that there is a expression of abstinence but high passion. This kind of abstinence and screaming expression will make women pay attention to the turbulence of adolescent lust. The shy deer smashed and swayed because the boy who liked accidentally touched himself from behind. Repeatedly recalling the memories of the audience will prompt people to enter the show, bring themselves into the point of view of the female pig&#39;s feet, and keep up with the rhythm of the plot. In addition, although feminists are very reluctant to agree, quite a part of the hallucinogens that evoke women&#39;s imagination comes from the expression of â€œabuseâ€, especially in East Asian women. The expression of body and lust is once negated and suppressed. In the state, it seems that only the battered condescension of male power can obtain its own emotional release. Women&#39;s imagination about love always needs to be manifested through abused and rescued behavior. (On this point, there is too much to say about the detailed discussion, and itâ€™s just that itâ€™s not too responsible for writing a few paragraphs.) Itâ€™s faster to write, itâ€™s a small view.After the feeling, but to remove the analysis of these academics, from the emotional point of view, see the tenth episode, every episode has a small climax, each episode is very arrested, the story frame is quite like gossip girls, but it has been removed a lot The place that does not conform to the aesthetics of the Orientals, while drawing on the beneficial elements, has achieved the perfect grafting with the local. I like this TV series especially at the current location, so I am very good at it. Originally, I would like to chase a bunch of American TV dramas, such as a good wife and a wife, and now I am directly at the second generation of this Korean rich. I want to write the story of the second generation of Chinese local tyrants. Itâ€™s really a learning attitude. Take a good look. What do you think about writing later? Today, the first thing, the ass hurts!",movie
918,"With Chinese films breaking through 10 billion for three consecutive years, China&#39;s status in the international film industry has gradually increased, and it has become the world&#39;s second largest film market. However, although the film market is a runner-up, Chinese films can be recognized as &quot;Kung Fu Movies&quot; and action stars in the world. The Chinese films that can win the Oscars are uniquely action movies, while the action films stars Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh are the representatives of Chinese filmmakers in the world. Showing their acting skills and strength to the world. However, although the strength of the tough guys is everywhere in China, but the Chinese film has not yet appeared as a tall and handsome idol-like tough guy like Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, can not help but regret. However, in the film &quot;The Twins Password&quot; released during the Singles Day, we saw a familiar figure. He is the Ji Feilong who plays the Southern School Master in &quot;The Master of the Generation&quot;! In his body, we seem to see the potential of the tough guy in China&#39;s first international idol! ! As one of the few domestic actors in Hollywood, Ji Feilong was praised by the Oscar judge Barry Mo Ruo as &quot;the most beautiful man in the East.&quot; In this &quot;Deaf Student Password&quot;, Ji Feilong starred in the drama of the leading actor, a 007-style American-American detective. As the first anti-international financial fraud suspense film in cooperation with the Hollywood team in China, in addition to the intrigues of the commercial war drama, the &quot;Tiansheng Password&quot; is the most thrilling action scene. Especially because there is a Hollywood team to join, so the action in the film is also quite a style of American blockbuster, and this point, in the poster, reveals the feeling of &quot;M:I&quot; like &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;. In fact, there are indeed US police detectives and international police officers who jointly investigate the contents of commercial crimes. In order to obtain the &quot;twin password&quot;, the various characters do not hesitate to make a big hit, so the action of the film is also very good-looking. Fans familiar with &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; should understand that the style of Atango is not only the coolness of dressing up, but also the challenge of challenging all kinds of stimuli, such as &quot;Mission Impossible 3&quot; in Chinese framing. Tang Ge challenged the Bank of China building in Shanghai, not only from the top of the building, but also sliding down the glass outside the building to the bottom of the building and fighting the enemy from time to time. This time, the &quot;Tiansheng Password&quot; was taken in Guangzhou, so the starring Ji Feilong directly challenged the Guangzhou landmark? Guangzhou Tower, also known as the &quot;small waist&quot;. In the film, the characters in the fight for the password in the Guangzhou Tower, after the fight, JiThe dragon sacrificed the most thrilling shots of the film and flew straight from the top of the tower of the Guangzhou Tower. This jump also made him the first person in China to leap the Guangzhou Tower. Not to bear the nickname of the &quot;Chinese Dragon&quot; he obtained in the United States! In addition to the Guangzhou Tower, &quot;The Twins Password&quot; is also on the Wall Street and Statue of Liberty in the United States. Ensuring that the film is a combination of Chinese and Western, both American and Chinese audiences can accept it. The action is powerful and the special effects are excellent, which also makes the film popular with foreign filmmakers. At present, many American filmmakers have purchased the copyright of this film. With the outstanding performance in &quot;Twins of the Twins&quot;, there is a handsome and handsome tough guy style and a Ji Feilong who looks like a mixed-race macho handsome face, is bound to become the new generation of Chinese film in Hollywood, and is very likely to become We Chinese own &quot;A Tango.&quot;",movie
919,"In modern society, both ordinary people and businessmen have a relationship with banks. For example, the settlement of wages is generally completed by the banking system. For example, most people will have several credit cards. For example, many people will get involved in the insurance industry to purchase some insurance products. For shadow banking, it is often poorly understood, but this does not mean that it is not important, and it does not mean that shadow banking lacks market in reality. The opposite is true. Almost everyone has a connection with the shadow bank. However, what exactly is the shadow bank, its impact on the ordinary people, the impact on the entire financial market and the national economy is often inconsistent, and even in the cloud. In this sense, Zhang Huaqiaoâ€™s â€œShadow Bank Insider: The Source of the Next Subprime Crisis? &quot;It just fills this gap, not only to bring the popularity of shadow banking knowledge to ordinary people, but also to clarify the development path of the entire shadow bank, but also to make bold predictions about its future direction. What is a shadow bank? This is slightly different between international and domestic definitions. According to the definition of Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, all financial businesses other than ordinary bank deposit and loan business are â€œshadow banksâ€, including bank wealth management products, trust products, micro-credit, private lending and pawn. However, the domestic definition is not in the financial sector within the scope of supervision of the central bank and the China Banking Regulatory Commission or the China Securities Regulatory Commission, that is, it has the meaning of being out of regulation. In any case, the so-called shadow banking is a financial business, but it is different from the deposit and loan business. The amount of such business is very large. For the international community and Chinese society, it is estimated that the size of China&#39;s shadow banking is about 26.6 trillion yuan, accounting for about 56% of nominal GDP, accounting for about 41% of bank credit. It can be seen that the number of shadow banks that already have a &quot;half of the size&quot; is actually not to be underestimated. So, what is the birth of shadow banking? The author gave his own answer. In fact, the answer is self-evident, that is, the demand for small and medium-sized enterprises and rural credit markets. It can be said that since the traditional bank&#39;s deposit and loan business is not enough for the real investment of small and medium-sized enterprises, and on the other hand there is a huge market demand, so shadow banking has a broad market demand. The other aspect is the basic requirement of interest rate marketization. In the Chinese market, due to the slow progress of marketization of interest rates, the strong control of the country has caused interest rates to fluctuate with the market demand. PlaceTherefore, there is actually a difference between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate. The existence of such a rate binary system is also the root cause of shadow banking. Because capital is profit-seeking, so in the case of huge profit margins, shadow banking came into being. Zhang Huaqiao&#39;s &quot;Shadow Bank Insider: The Source of the Next Subprime Crisis?&quot; This book not only gives the basic knowledge of these shadow banks, but more valuable should be regarded as an autobiographical writing technique, that is, the book also shifts from foreign banks to Guangdong Wansui small amount. The experience of credit companies has come to the fore, because microfinance itself is part of the shadow banking. Zhang Huaqiaoâ€™s experience and appearance, especially his thrilling experience in the three-year microfinance company, is undoubtedly a microcosm of the development of Chinaâ€™s shadow banking. In particular, the three laws it proposes deserve our deep thought: Where there is supervision, there are violations; where there are import tariffs, there is smuggling; where there is interest rate control, there are underground money houses. These three laws are not only a true portrayal of their three-year microfinance, but also an objective summary of the government&#39;s supervision of the financial market. Note: The book review has published &quot;China Publishing Media Business Daily&quot;, &quot;Yangcheng Evening News&quot; and &quot;Beijing Morning News&quot;.",movie
920,"Generally, if you see a young person&#39;s film, you will not be interested, or even contemptuous. If you encounter a preaching, you will be annoyed. But this part is totally different. Have the classic qualities of my high-scoring film - different people may have quite different feelings. At first, a little young man in the colleague strongly recommended it, which is just one of the best movies he has ever seen. So there seems to be some expectations, but it is rare that there is no disappointment at all. Although Xiao Nanzhuâ€™s acting skills are oysters, every time there is a strong tension, it is often frowning and clenching his teeth, but the whole can make people enter the play, very nervous and excited. The good-looking place is mainly the plot. After all, there are best-selling novels. While watching, I think that teenagers should be the favorite film that makes them out of the limelight. As a result, at the end of the climax, it seems that they are shocked by the slap in the face! Looking back and thinking and making a fuss, the reason why I was surprised was because I went too far into the perspective of the protagonist. If you consider it from the perspective of &quot;adult&quot;, this is basically a long-term inevitable practice. Of course, this practice is ridiculous if it is realistically, but it can make people believe in two hours in the film, otherwise there is no way to enjoy the story. . . . . . Because of the shocking feeling at the end, I had to give 4.5 points. I thought that I was a hero, a Savior, and an important person on the shoulders of Taishan. I was suddenly slap in the face and found that I was actually a little puppet, used ruthlessly, but extremely angry, but Can&#39;t resist, can&#39;t even refute. I was shocked by this shameless and cruel. But what if it is not done, what is better? Isn&#39;t this a solution that has been successfully achieved to achieve the goal and proved to be perfect? In addition, whether or not someone else has hurt you, others still have the ability to hurt you. Are you going to preemptively killing the whole family is just self-defense? There is no solution for the time being, but it can be said that it can lead to some discussion topics. When I feel that I have less than 4.5 points, I have an important reason. First, the opening theme of the article &quot;Understanding the Enemy&quot; has not been able to fully express its understanding of what is unclear about the enemy. How to understand it is even more foggy and most crucial. This understanding of &quot;knowing ourselves and knowing each other&quot; is a victory in war. Does it play any role? Second, the key tactics of Nanzhujiao cannot withstand scrutiny. The real war is over in ten minutes. It is a routine when practicing with children. It is the key to using a lot of cannon fodder.In the middle, a large amount of cannon fodder was surrounded by enemy fire, and the sacrifice of cannon fodder was exchanged for the final victory. The old tune is a problem. Another problem is that I really donâ€™t appreciate this all or nothing. Killing a thousand, self-damaged eight hundred, the cannon fodder can reach the last minute or not. The key to winning a gamble is whether there are enough cannons to block the guns. Where is the so-called cleverness? ? ! After the Tucao is completed, the overall entertainment is very strong, and Nanzhu is expected to become a new generation of girl killers.",movie
921,"When there are multiple cultures coexisting, there is a problem of superiority and inferiority. Culture itself has advantages and disadvantages. Culture has no national distinction. Advanced culture can be well integrated with the nationality of the country. The development of civilization, the corresponding culture, is also the promotion of the economy, the promotion of military power, the world, in the end is the struggle for power, not your culture, I can not adopt, but if adopted by your culture can Conducive to the development of the country, why can&#39;t I give up my original culture and adopt your culture, culture, consciousness, technology, these things are limited to a certain region, but the whole world, is formed in the world As part of the mainstream culture, culture comes from communication. Our culture does not mean that our culture itself is a shared property. Once an electric light is invented, it does not belong to Edison. This is not what I have said, but the characteristics of the thing itself. Culture itself is more of a secondary thing. More cultures can truly bring our country into a more prosperous country, which is beneficial to the country. Our ideology Our various things can be decided with a way to make our country stronger and stronger. If our things can&#39;t guarantee a country&#39;s lasting competitiveness and can&#39;t make our comprehensive strength improve, then it is harmful. That is what we need to improve. We are moving towards the ultimate goal, then what is not to be abandoned. There must be such a global consciousness to truly establish the core position of the country. If this core is regarded as a culture, it is a cultural idea that is constantly improving. A common thing between cultures, a kind of thing we explain whether a culture can keep up with the times. Japanâ€™s animation country, Japanâ€™s way of thinking is a kind of shaping of the country, a kind of ideology built on the whole people, and through this shaping, it can guarantee that the country has lasting competitiveness. The current pattern of Japan is What, what kind of confrontation with China means, no matter who the war is, it is not important. What is important is that it has already jumped up. The ideological struggle itself is meaningless. The power of others means its own. Weak, such a big cake, so many people come to divide, you are divided more, I will be less, your military strength is growing, whether I grow or not, but if my growth rate is not fast, then It is a kind of backwardness. China threat theoryIn fact, it existed from the very beginning. Of course, it is not just the Chinese threat theory. As long as a country is strong, then he is a threat to other countries. Just as the current United States is strong and threatening any nation, he You can attack other countries, intervene in other countries, and buy strong sales. In the discussion between countries, it is also a leader&#39;s role. Even Japan is the same. When his country is strong, the biggest threat is his neighboring countries. When the neighboring countries are strong, the biggest threat is their own country, just like the former Meiji Restoration in Japan. Success, China is lagging behind, then, automatically provides an environment in which Japan attacks China, his power means aggression, and in fact, when, at any moment in history, this law has not been violated, a country Strong, then there are other countries to suffer. After the military strength is far beyond, then the war is set up in this shift of power. Just as Germany was strong before, it needs to suffer from the whole of Europe. If Chinaâ€™s power means that Japan is backward, it means China will inevitably invade other countries. The time is not right. China will never be able to wage war with Japan at such a moment. The first is that China has no absolute advantage to guarantee the winning phase of such a war. In addition, Chinaâ€™s opponents are not Japan, the United States, and Russia. The war is all about the world at this time, and China is at any time. Nothing like this time, I feel that time is so precious, I am striving for greater peace, and I can fight for the future in the war years. Just because of his power, there is no other country to attack, his neighboring countries. Nor does it have the ability to threaten his status. This also means that the United States can protect its own economy from the ravages of war. The same is true of a super-strong situation, but China is different, in India, Japan, and South Korea. These countries are themselves an integrated pattern, and the development of neighboring countries will seriously threaten their survival. The contradiction is also carried out in this way. Just as in the situation in Europe, how many countries come together, how can there be no contradiction? If the current boss is you, then it means that if I have the strength, I can also challenge your boss status, the war is official. In the situation of how strong there is, if there is a war between China and Japan, the United States may stay out of the way, is his decision as ifWhen Europe faces a disaster, it sends a war money. The first prerequisite is that it is absolutely impossible for the United States to directly enter their competition. He probably will not intervene in this relationship. If China and Japan want war, they must Considering the factors of the United States, there will be no large-scale conflicts, unless the two are idiots. The team is not a good thing between the two. Moreover, if the war happens, it must happen under the impetus of the economic crisis. In the context of the destruction of economic competitiveness, the government has provided an advantage for the war ideology in order to alleviate this economic pressure. Now, the outbreak of war is still very limited. Japanâ€™s comprehensive strength, in fact, and now China, war simply cannot end in a short period of time, and this is itself a very unfavorable act for the country. Although China suffers from it, it is absolutely harmless to Japan, which means The current challenge in Japan is only a bluff, and the ideological struggle itself is untenable, and the problems such as the Diaoyu Island of Diaoyu Island can not cause any huge crisis. The battle between organizations cannot be like The battle between people is like that. Now that China has reached a turning point, the threat of Japan actually wants not to fight, but more to drag down China, especially in such a period of reform-sensitive period, dragging down Chinaâ€™s economy, This is a very important strategy. Does the Chinese government suffer from such temptations? I don&#39;t know. China today, although in terms of total volume, is not at the same level as Japan in terms of quality. In order to win the final battle, it is impossible to avoid any competition in such a period of time. In the future In the battle, in order to stay at the forefront, it is absolutely necessary to raise the countryâ€™s economic and cultural management to a level that is truly a big country. The Japanese are not idiots. He accepts the same traditional culture as China. The books that can be seen in China are basically a lot of Japanese. He has been studying China. In this respect, Chinaâ€™s biggest rival now is In Japan, during the reform and opening up, it can be said that there is no opportunity for China to be an opportunity. For Japan, why is it not? They have jointly opened up the market. The two countries together constitute the biggest challenge to the US hegemony. In fact, I think In the current situation, what is more needed is that China and Japan have joined forces to contain the United States, not the other way around. In fact, the current situation is indeed the case.",movie
922,"After reading the film, I realized how good the title &quot;The End of the World&quot; was. One understanding: Several protagonists plan to finish their hometown? The name of the last one of the 12 pubs owned by Newton Haven. Double understanding: the hometown of several protagonists? The end of Newton Haven. Triple understanding: The end of contemporary civilization, led by information technology, returned to the Middle Ages. There are many scenes in the film that are reminiscent of similar elements in other movies. For example, several protagonists&#39; execution plans were intercepted by blue blood people, which seemed to be playing a game. At the bottom of the &quot;World End&quot; pub, it looks like the scene in &quot;The Soul City&quot;. The dialogue between the two sides also makes people reflect. For example, the blue blood people created the Datong ideal of the Galaxy network (think that the earth civilization has repeatedly shown the same cycle of self-destruction, and therefore needs to be improved) and the debauchery of the Earth people (such as the fat man&#39;s sentence, &quot;our stupidity is beyond your imagination&quot; For example, Gary said that &quot;doing bad people is our basic human right, and earth civilization is based on rotten people.&quot;). And this dialogue, like the battle of Zhou Xingchi&#39;s &quot;Nine Pieces of Sesame Officials&quot;, is still the end of the victory of the Earth people, so that the aliens who think that &quot;swearing is a proof of human immaturity&quot; finally endured a sentence. Swearing: Fuck it (no matter). The changes of several protagonists 20 years ago and the current insistence on the ideals of the year seem to see similar scenes and themes in the chopstick brother &quot;Old Boy&quot;. The story ends with two characters telling the story. It must be admitted that before the viewing, I did not expect to be associated with aliens. Compared to &quot;Hangover&quot;, because of drunkenness to make a series of ridiculous routines, the film&#39;s creativity is really a lot higher. For example, in the ending, &quot;Now life is difficult, but it is also simple. At least it is eaten as natural food, and does not miss processed food.&quot; If you think of the poor traffic and atmosphere of the emperor, I really want to go back to ancient times, just like &quot;mobile phone.&quot; &quot;The silent confession played by Zhang Guoli is still good in ancient society.&quot; Everything has two sides. How to balance is what we have to think about. For example, how to protect the environment while developing the economy.",movie
923,"A few days ago, I saw someone mentioning Angelopoulos in a review of the film review. I am ignorant, I know for the first time that I have someone. I will finish watching this work tonight. The movie was downloaded on March 28, 2012. Together with &quot;Shen Jingru Hai&quot;, the person who was uploaded was classified as &quot;French Literature and Art Film Collection&quot;. Then I think this is a French movie. After reading the first-ranked film review, I realized that this is a Greek film taken by a Greek director. See the July 20th, 2008 short commentary saying &quot;Asleep, can&#39;t see where the classic is.&quot; I&#39;m not. In the first cry, the boy cried when he saw the horse in front of him. In addition, after I was sent to Jain and indirectly learned about the situation of my brother and sister, I have already paid close attention to what will happen to my father-in-lawâ€™s journey to find a father? The younger brother went to the restaurant to work to earn a piece of sandwich, and to find the scene with his sister, let me cry. It must be said that the little actor who plays the younger brother is so cute, whether it is wearing, hair or skin, it is a beautiful and affectionate boy. If the two brothers and sisters are going all the way from Greece to the north, how can it snow in front, then the two brothers and sisters are in the rain (doesn&#39;t it go further north, is the snow bigger?). It is the scene on the poster. The younger brother said: I can&#39;t walk. It makes me very uncomfortable. My sister stopped the car, and then it was the cruel scene. I even hate the director a bit. Why do you have to show the evil side of human nature, is it not enough for the younger brothers and sisters? You have to arrange this. It is also strange, why my sister does not call, in the &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, when Hao Hongmei was bullied by a bachelor, the son of three or four years old brightened and rescued himself with a little girl. The second cry was that the sister and the kindly motorbike youth had the show. My sister is loading too much. I have been thinking before, when bullied by a truck driver, she knows what the bad guys have done to themselves? Later, when she took the initiative to go to the motorcycle hotel room, she should know such things and it seems to be precocious. This was proved at the end of the scene at the train station to ask a soldier for money. Fortunately, the director did not continue to cruel to the girl. But because there is no passport, there is a patrol of the back gun soldiers on the border, and I am worried that the brothers and sisters will avoid the bullets. Finally, the gunshots still sounded. At the end, the younger brother&#39;s figure gradually became clear in the fog. He called his sister, &quot;Wake up, we went to Germany&quot;, and there was no response. I thought my sister was shot dead on the boat. Fortunately, after a while, my sisterâ€™s voice &quot;I am afraid&quot; sounded, and then the brothers and sisters walked hand in hand to a tree in front, which was a little peace of mind. Can not help but be a brother and sisterThe road ahead is worried.",movie

926,"Among the various action films of style and type, the so-called real kungfu is the most gold-rich one, because such films have never been like special effects, firearms or other techniques since Bruce Leeâ€™s opening ceremony. The means to opportunistically improve the viewing effect, but to completely challenge the limits of the human body by virtue of the filmmaker&#39;s martial arts, showing the ability to truly belong to the filmmaker, the charm of martial arts. The famous martial artist and kung fu moviemaker Chen Tianxingâ€™s self-directed &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; is such a genuine real kung fu movie. Through a story of self-redemption by a warrior, the audience can experience the pure kung fu experience and the military The beliefs, emotions, life and martial arts philosophy are displayed on the big screen. It is a sincere work with fierce action and true feelings and lively fragrance. &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; aimed the camera at a male protagonist, through his series of life and death tests after becoming a kung fu star, launched his martial arts, his fanaticism and madness, the road of glory and confusion, performance Faced with this prosperous world, a warrior is faced with the pressure of his heart, facing the difficult choices of fame and fortune, money and lust, thus showing that no matter whether it is a warrior or a star, or an unnamed kung fu boy, the first thing to do is to do it. A person, like a line in the film: &quot;People live not only for themselves, but more importantly, to fulfill others.&quot; Martial arts is endowed with another philosophy of survival. There are a lot of imposing action scenes in the film, such as Chen Tianxing and Sanda Wang Liu Hailong&#39;s wonderful showdown, Chen Tianxing and the French action star Alexandria&#39;s violent and extraordinary fight, in Chen Tianxing&#39;s meticulous arrangement, and a lot of hits Under the star of the battle, it became a model on this year&#39;s big screen. The jaw-dropping, boxing and flesh-fighting confrontation in the film is enough to ignite the passion of the audience. The fights in the game are dazzling and dazzling, and people canâ€™t help but be addicted. . Although Chen Tianxing is a martial artist, his understanding of the film is not superficial. The texture of the film, the design of the scene, and the narrative of the narrative are very well-documented. At the same time, while Chen Tianxing is attracting kung fu fans and male audiences with the hard work of Kung Fu, the demand for female viewers is also fully provided. The use of various commercial elements is very skillful and pleasing, whether vivid or not. The delicate emotional drama, or the glamorous appearance of the famous beauty model Wang Linna, effectively makes the film have a strong sense of fashion. RecentThe Kung Fu movies have been warmed up. Many kung fu movies like to use &quot;real kungfu&quot; to make their own names, but most of them belong to the city, and the real kung fu movies have been rare for many years. But what is the real real kung fu, in fact, there is no strict conclusion, not the real fight is really hard, real Kung Fu movies should have extraordinary martial arts content like &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot;, with the highest level of action The show gave back to the audience. The film won the &quot;Best Action Design Award&quot; at the 9th American AOF International Film Festival in the past, and the &quot;Guangzhou Gwangju Film Festival &quot;Action Art Achievement Award&quot;.

927,"Human beings are very strange species. The so-called human nature is even more difficult to ponder. Especially when human nature is tortured in an extreme environment, it often gets a complicated result. Many people vomit the film&#39;s plot logic is not strict, the emotional drama is not clear, the competition for survival is not violent, and even the shaking of the shooting is not suitable (to be honest, I did not notice that there is still shaking the lens). In my opinion, these are not what the film wants to express. The human performance is the essence of this movie. Just as we keep the mice in cages, design the scenes to observe their movements, study their behavior, and even as biologists study the hive, the ant, and the behavior of their entire group. This movie is to put the whole human being in a sand table in the future, and then look at human performances from afar. This is a centralized world, oppression and rebellion, war and punishment, cruel child supply system, and finally an extremely distorted hunger game. Repeatedly repeating the phrase &quot;I hope that opportunity will always be good for you&quot;, hypocritical and pale, this The world is filled with suffocating repression. Human beings perform themselves in such an environment, from the president, the strange people of Capital, the game designers, to the enslaved 12th district, everyone is living and performing according to their understanding of the world. After being suppressed, human nature is instinctive, oppression and resistance. Since the birth of mankind has always been the main theme of performance, the ruling class has been looking for a solution to the Silver Bullet. The ancient Chinese people have contributed a classic: killing people. In fact, the essence of this game is a means of domination. The purpose is to completely kill the hopes of the people in the slavery, let them live numbly and obediently, just like worker bees. Unfortunately, the editorial comprehension and leadership gap of the game is too big. It is simple to make the game more fun and to cater to the audience. It is just that the people of Capital are not everyone who realizes that this is a means of struggle for your life and death. They care about entertainment. &quot;, after the entertainment packaged love, inspirational and even death. Therefore, the audience supports the female lord, but they do not know that in order to survive and strive to please their female lord before the TV, the flame ignited after winning, may eventually devour all the luxury sluts they are used to, just like their nickname to the female lord. - Flame girl, flame, whether it is the fire of hope or the fire of hell. This is the epitome of human society. We are both an audience and an actor. Maybe a long time later, when we study the human species, we will sigh the social structure of the species.The complexity, the confusion of human nature, may be touched by some kind of human emotions. Just like Rueâ€™s death in the movie and the innocent Rue, the woman and all the people in the 11th district pay tribute together with three fingers. There is always a power to discover that it is driving humanity.",movie
928,"As I said in the commentary &quot;The City of Exceptional Beauty&quot;, some films can only be photographed in Italy, and some films are really only the French people can grasp the essence. Although the individual does not like to talk about the words, but after the end of the movie, I really feel that this is the film that I have seen the most perfect gay theme. How does Alain Guiraudie, in a simple and special environment, in the simplest number of characters, in a direct and natural lens, shows that this group is beyond the limits of this so-called &quot;civilization&quot; era about nature, society, The attributes of humanity and emotion are really admirable. I have to say that the sex and the subsequent flaws are indispensable. The lack of any film is not much different from other similar films. From the moral responsibility of several major characters, the metaphor of the lines, the subtle combination of subjective lens and fixed lens, can be read again and again. This is not a slap in the face, not as casual as his own picture, everything is strictly and yet full of artistic talents.",movie

When I was reading, I saw that &quot;some things can only be seen by the eyes of children.&quot; This level is seen after the age of 30. It is the atmosphere of family love and affection. Xiaomei has no one to play, but she has to squeeze with her sister. &quot;Going to school&quot; Dad rides a bicycle for two hours. She takes her sister to the hospital to visit her mother. She whispers to her mother that she has a &quot;monster&quot; in her house. She is worried that her mother does not like Xiaomeiâ€™s firm embrace. Looking at the corn that I have picked up/can cure all the diseases, I have to look at my mother regardless of everything, and the people around me, there are several families who are really happy. I forgot to read a line in a beautiful drama:&quot; Why, is your family very happy? Meeting a totoro is not a fairy tale. A family that loves each other is a truly distant fairy tale.",movie
930,"The fate of the future of the Atlantic Empire is not easy to judge. I only know that if I follow the historical clues, according to the rhythm of the season for about one year (note: the year in the play), if the prohibition of alcohol is over, it is possible to shoot ten seasons. Some people compared this drama with the repertoires such as &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; and &quot;House of Cards&quot;. I just want to say that this kind of comparison is of little significance. Of course, the male owner is a middle-aged black man is a clue. However, if you look at such a lot of American dramas, you can see that the American dramas such as &quot;Absolute&quot; and &quot;Paper&quot; are based on elaborate production. The scriptwriting ideas generally follow the consistent routine of American dramas? The twists and turns continue. The &quot;Atlantic Empire&quot; is not in a hurry to advance like this, especially in the fourth quarter. &quot;Atlantic Empire&quot; is the most exquisite American drama made in recent years. In the huge story clue, no one character is superfluous. He is responding to Chekhovâ€™s sentence: If there is a pistol at the beginning of the story, it must be launched before the end. Moreover, the subtext of this play is very superb. The same is black, the revenge of the house of cards is timely, with a pleasing pleasure, while the Atlantic is full of patience, and the final total explosion is shocking. It is also such a feature that the number of people destined to watch the show will gradually decrease with each season&#39;s launch (see the number of people who scored the Douban). Domestic video sites will naturally not introduce this drama.",movie

It is not a good thing, because it will be criticized for not being wide-ranging; but for the movie itself, it is the cost of selling a seat, but unfortunately the selection is lost and quickly submerged. Like LeTV&#39;s &quot;I want to be nice with you&quot;, this film also takes the name of the seven-character film, but whether it is &quot;I want to be with you&quot; or &quot;I love you, love me&quot;, After reading it, I can use it as a mantra for couples. The protagonists of the two films are equally &quot;made&quot;. The actor is engaged in the advertising industry. The local uncle who plays the role of Zhang Hanyu is willing to lower his body and tie the laces to his lover. Unleashing the charm that matches his age, his problem is that he &quot;decides to end a relationship&quot; too often, and in fact, feelings are not &quot;being decided to end&quot; and then &quot;there is no trace of a dream.&quot; The two of them remembered each other, and the final result could only be echoed or lingered. In this movie, we saw the latter: Li Chengyuanâ€™s Chen Yuâ€™s wrist and Wang Baijieâ€™s Xiaoleâ€™s boyfriend were almost crazy. ... Because of a period of obsession, there are too many victims, and they also create or experience stories because of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;victimization&quot;, which in turn adds drama to the film. This should be considered a film. Love is easy to be sad; if you don&#39;t love, you are lonely. Between the two, whoever is chosen, by people is more law. The heroine who lives in &quot;I love you, love me&quot; chooses to remember, the consequences, press, no matter, the act itself, can be praised, which reminds me of the many years that many people knowEveryday, the little girl who posted a message on the website of everyone who died on her boyfriend?? This kind of story that is moving and powerful in the secular world, we canâ€™t do it, so we hope that they can really happen and hope. They can end early.",movie
932,"The fabulous film, &quot;The Beauty&quot; is not only used to interpret the Eternal City of Rome, but also shows the exquisiteness of this film. Director Paul Solentino has more than once allowed the audience to admire his superb film skills. The glamour of &quot;Big Star&quot; is still faintly visible, and &quot;The City of Beauty&quot; is even more amazing. Such a film is awe-inspiring to the film, reminding people that the significance of the existence of the film as the seventh largest art category is sometimes not to be appreciated with popcorn. &quot;The City of Beauty&quot; takes all aspects of photography, montage, pictures, stories, performances and other films to the extreme and finds the best balance. It can almost be said that this film is a perfect movie. The opening of the film is a series of exquisite clips that Sorrento is good at. The picture, lens and soundtrack are just right. The classic montage effect outlines the gorgeous chapters. The classical soundtrack is like an aria. The momentum, followed by the sharp dance of the song and dance, opened the first chapter of the story, the back of Tony Cervello first appeared in the film, an innocent old playboy image is simply straightforward to the audience, the subsequent story is only Around this person, even the story itself is extravagant, and shaping this character is the core content of the film. The 65-year-old Jabil Ganbardella lives at the top of the city, always overlooking the whole picture of Rome, wandering in the luxurious social circle and walking along with the celebrities, the hidden scenery behind it is hidden The &quot;mental problem&quot; in the bottom of my heart, like the neighbors who have turned a blind eye for ten years, is actually the top ten wanted criminals in the world. The sudden plot of the ending is obviously a symbol of the director. The whole film is full of metaphors, symbols and words in the words. The film goes beyond the story itself conveyed by the picture, exquisitely extending the story in every shot and every line, savoring itself is to taste art, taste life, taste life and death, taste a lot of eternal Proposition. There are a lot of scenes of high-class PARTY interspersed in the film. In almost every PARTY, the directors start from the original sin of the same desire. The surprise is that each time the foothold is different, there is a sensual erosion. There are sorrowful thoughts, tired bodies, angry catharsis, too many nowhere to put the emotions on, or nowhere to put, seemingly vented, vented emotions, the result only depends on whether you can deceive yourself and deceive yourself.The director has accurately designed each PATRY and party, interspersed with each seemingly inadvertent stage of the story. If the interpretation from the whole will touch the sensitive nerves of the audience, and the director&#39;s discussion is repeated step by step. Pushing the final question to the audience, perhaps &quot;Flaubert is really like writing a book that doesn&#39;t say anything, but he didn&#39;t succeed.&quot; The director has long sprinkled the seeds of nihilism until the end of the film. When Jabil Ganbardella answered the question of the nun, he gave a pessimistic flower? The nun asked him: &quot;Why didn&#39;t you write a book after that?&quot; Jabil Ganbardella replied: &quot; I want to find something better, but... I didn&#39;t find it.â€ Another theme of the film is art. There is so much art in Italy that the director can use it to express his ideas. Even the city itself is a Unique pieces of art, shaped cities, sculptures, fine works, invisible music, singing, artistic elements throughout the film from beginning to end, the director gave them in their own movies The new form of life and the new life of the work, in addition to the proper display of their beauty, also gave them more symbolic meaning, perhaps the city of Rome is not the same as our impression in the lens, the director showed He is not an old one. Although the magnificent Colosseum has appeared in the background several times, it is not lonely with the modern dance music. Since it is inevitable that the Roman director will encounter historical problems, but The focus of the director is obviously on the present, and the vision is obviously in the future. Therefore, the historical elements in the film are often used for modern and even post-modern interpretation. The value of art is not displayed in the museum for people to appreciate. The form makes them lively and inspires the audience, making the plot thought-provoking. It is the director&#39;s numerous symbolic techniques that have made a great breakthrough in the form. Not only is the unique cooperation of the lens and the clip, but even in many episodes, the director boldly plays the role, which makes the film sparkle with passion. The often-considered results are astounding and amazing. Whether you can appreciate the beauty of formalism, you may not be able to avoid the unique experience of the director&#39;s flamboyant approach. In fact, the beauty of formalism is like the temptation of uniforms. Some people like sailor suits. Some people like professional wear. Of course, there are many people who take all the food. The form and connotation have always been the issue of immortality.It is often the same word, and the form has people who feel that they are showing off, and the connotation is often boring, but the film combines the form and the connotation just right, the director finds the balance between the two, The real art is first and foremost in form, because the connotation is always over-interpreted, and only the form can be truly immortal. In this film, both the elaborate scenes and the performance and artistic plots in the plot are all reflected. With the director&#39;s thinking and purpose, the whole movie is not so simple in telling stories in the package of sound and light painting. It is even difficult to connect the plots in the movie after watching the movie, but it still remembers all the plots. This is the essence of formalism. It is necessary to let people ignore the content to some extent, to gain different thinking from the intuitive experience, to get a different conclusion from the past, or to have no conclusion at all, to appreciate and think. Most meaningful, because all meaningful criticism is essential to accompanying thinking. As a human-centered film, the starring can&#39;t be mentioned, whether or not he knows the film&#39;s main Tony? Severo believes that the film will be convinced by his performance, in this film his dedication master class The expression is a highlight that the film can hardly ignore. His performances are completely without traces of the past. In the three films of &quot;The City of the Beautiful&quot;, &quot;The Big Star&quot; and &quot;Gomera&quot;, the characters he created are not repeated. Traces, even let the audience ignore the three most important Italian films in recent years are starred by a name, a good actor just so that people forget their name and unforgettable character&#39;s voice and smile. A great movie is always exciting. &quot;The City of the Beauty&quot; is a great work among great movies. Just like its Italian name &quot;LA GRANDE BELLEZZA&quot; is a great beauty. In fact, this is not a The film so interpreted can only be experienced when it is seen.",movie

Itâ€™s hard to breathe; the memories are all sad, absurd, and there is no truth; for example, the words of Milan Kundera make people laugh and cry, smile and sorrow; the more the history is the more the truth Itâ€™s ridiculous to catch the wind; just as the train coming from the black hole at the end of the movie crushed the DNA report from the United States; is it true? 100%? Who is escaping into the black hole is really innocent? Was the man who raised the muzzle up a few centimeters not the one who had tortured the confession and did not believe in the law? Sin is no longer directed to someone, but to everyone; everyone is both a victim and a perpetrator. Even the last suspect who looked like a green man looked at the screen with blood on his lips; finally turned to the screen from the policeman&#39;s policeman; isn&#39;t it the viewer of Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China, who is watching movies because there is no idol in it? Facebook, everyone is so ordinary, even if there is a violent tendency, the policeman 2 finally smashed a nail and lacked a leg; what they bear is what our neighbors friends have now and will bear. What makes people scared is that the police are mortal, the mortal is mortal, the victim is mortal. And we are helpless in the darkness of human nature. The focus is not on who is guilty, but on who is convicted? The brother of the card is correct; we used to be too anxious to get results, too, and want to draw a conclusion. And now we are more focused on the process of judgment, the rationality in the process. But reason is not the end, it is the starting point of the pursuit of truth with the sensibility. It is a sorrow and fearlessness.",movie
934,"A poor fisherman in Palestine caught a boar in the sea one day, which is not a slap in the face of a believer in Islam. A few days after secretly shutting the pig in the cabin, the fisherman tried his best to dispose of the unknown. In the case of personal risk, I contacted a Russian girl in the hostile Israeli area. I thought I could make a quick trip and make a big profit. I didnâ€™t think that the girl would match the sowâ€™s semen for the sow. This can be anxious for the fisherman, the pig is not sold, but also let the pigs move, how can this be good. First, the photo of the beautiful pig is covered in the cabin, and the fisherman will start again. After several transactions with the girl, the fisherman earned a lot of money. But in the end, things were still exposed. As a last resort, the fisherman took his wife, the girl with the children, and the pig, and began a ridiculous escape. Directed by the French journalist Sylvie Estibar, the film shows the complexities and problems in the Palestinian area in the name of a pig. The garrison on the roof, the discussion of the pig problem, the religious beliefs, the contradictions between the Palestinians and the Jews, and the various complicated political issues were all manifested. The old Iraqi actor Saison? Gabriel is a fascinating interpretation of all the laughter points. Unknown Russian girls are also amazingly amazing. The film won the Best Debut Award at the 37th Caesar Award and the Audience Award at the 24th Tokyo International Film Festival. For those who like to pay attention to the chaos in the Middle East, it may not be too strange to see the scene. Due to the compact geographical location and the entanglement of historical issues, not only the perennial wars, but also the religious beliefs are so strange that the people of various roads and nationals have to spend a long time in poverty and strife. Under the guidance of fishermen and pigs, the film shows these kinds of topics one by one, without losing the humorous and funny taste, closing the ignorant thoughts, the true and warm bridges, and the ideals of yearning for peace and beauty. A more profound irony is that a problem that a pig can solve requires several generations of constant disputes and debates.",movie

940,"&quot;Lang Reader&quot;, 85 points. After reading for a long time, I pondered two questions. First, why did Mike have a chance to reduce Hannahâ€™s sentence in the past, but turned away in the snowy team? Second, Hannah was sentenced to life imprisonment. She stayed in prison for 23 years and insisted on committing suicide after seeing Mike one week before she finally got out of prison. This is a good story. When the 66-year-old Hannahâ€™s white hair looked up and looked at Mike, who had been away for many years, it made me cry. A rough, straightforward and beautiful 40-year-old woman meets a 15-year-old boy. It originated from the power of lust. It was never thought that this short summer had affected the life of the boy and also changed Hanna. The wheel of fortune was unexpected, and I never thought that I would have such a great strength. After many years, I found the painful facts in the light of the wind. I donâ€™t know what to say about other peopleâ€™s lives. It seems that the old people are coming, only May each other be treasured. Those sincere pains that have the feelings of the candle bones will probably change everyone more or less. On weekdays, I laughed and sullenly lived, and the traces of the past appeared in my dreams. Some corners that I couldnâ€™t catch, fell into the details and shaped us today. Who said it is good, not that I donâ€™t say it, I donâ€™t know, some things are only suitable for collection. I think that Mikeâ€™s reason for not revealing the truth is to realize that the humiliation of illiterate is more difficult for Hannah than to imprison, and the second is to queue up to visit the sky and snow. The scene makes me think that the victims of Auschwitz are waiting in line to die, maybe Mike is the same? When it comes to the death of Hannah, she finally realized her ruthlessness in the end. In the tragedy of the extinction of human history, whether it is the Nazi Japanese army or the decade of the Cultural Revolution, it will always be blamed on the few culprit, but it is not known that the most terrible and most sad of these evils is that the humanity of most people is dark and ugly. Excited, the selfish tyrannical cold and cruel darkness, gathered into a black hole that swallowed everything ~ ~ Hannah, is there no bright humanity? Since she loved reading aloud very early, the famous masterpiece is the foreplay of countless times of love. It is also the faint pleasure of the concentration camp. Seeing her tears in the church is so good and dazzling, why not call the youngsters deeply loved? Strange things, people can split into this, the same person can take care of the concentration camp, and there is no pity in the fire, no mistake. And those who pointed out that she is the mastermind, it is evil in the evil, how ugly face! Hannah is cold, but she has always been frank, from the perspective of Mike&#39;s love and obsession, how can she not hate ~ ~ her death stems from the indifference and indifference? The hand that originated from Mike&#39;s retraction stems from the hope that the expectations that have been held for so many years are finally lost.I need to think about it again.

She took Oscar with &quot;Lang Reader&quot; and loved her vicissitudes of sharp beauty, blending with each character. &quot;Road of Revolution&quot; is not as subtle and deep as &quot;Lang Reader&quot;, but it is like a cloud. It is praised as follows: 1. This film is better than the couple&#39;s way. The other two couples appearing in the film and look very much. The beautiful Wheeler couples are in stark contrast. The end of the film, the old man indifferently pulling out the hearing aid and not wanting to listen to the old woman&#39;s malicious slap in the face is very intriguing. Happy marriages are the same, and unfortunate marriages have their own sorrows. You should be with the person who makes you better~~2, you are not happy, you will not be happy anywhere, whether you are in a small town in the United States, or you can hear the fascinating Paris, or the smog and Chinese cities with blue sky alternately.

Frank and her marriage had a fatal crack, but what about the environment? It is not a lover in her heart. Maybe a woman is always easy to fall in love with fantasy.

944,"Before the release of &quot;Rhyme Carpooling&quot;, I wrote an article about &quot;Terrorist Films and Don&#39;t Play &quot;Chicken Flying Eggs&quot; for &quot;100 Carpooling&quot; rewards, which is intended to supervise &quot;è¯¡æ‹¼è½¦&quot; The imaginary move, I did not expect the director&#39;s tension to be busy in the article &quot;toward the Tucao forward&quot; response. At the same time, the director expressed his humility, and apparently revealed some uncomfortable feelings. He also said to me that I would like to talk about the papers: &quot;Don&#39;t just point your finger at the country, but be able to practice and film your own stories.&quot; I would like to say that I have also participated in the planning and production of Ye Weixin&#39;s &quot;Ghost Story&quot; and other films. The works are not satisfactory, and the slots are as good as the cows, but I will not ask the sputters to practice pens, just like your mobile phone. I am not happy, I can&#39;t say: &quot;You have the ability to make one yourself!&quot; Based on the premature affair, I must see the &quot;Carpooling&quot;, even before the popular film &quot;Raytheon 2&quot;. In general, the artistic pursuit of &quot;Carpooling&quot; is higher than many domestically produced horror films. The image temperament and narrative techniques also have the director&#39;s personal characteristics, and have reached a certain new height in suspense, but far from enough to make the director&#39;s confidence burst. To the point. In view of the director&#39;s &quot;Tucao Fund&quot;, the high-profile screaming &quot;If there is a viewer who can find out the flaws in the film, you will get a cash reward&quot;, I can&#39;t really blame the spectators who don&#39;t provoke. First of all, the proposition of &quot;è¯¡è½¦è½¦è½¦&quot; is not tight, and even a bit of a problem. The film is based on carpooling and gimmicks. It is mistaken to think that it is a road movie. However, the journey has just begun to get better. It just stopped on the wrong side of the rainy night, and the story suddenly turned into Fan Ye, the escape of the wilderness villa. Therefore, carpooling is not the core value of the film. It is only a means of gathering some characters, while the core figure artist is waiting for the wilderness villa. It is the core home of the film. The film is called &quot;Wild Villa&quot;. Taking carpooling as an incision solves the problem of the character&#39;s source, but it always creates an irreparable gap. It is a pity that this is supposed to be a suspense film that can get out of the secret room and escape, and the result is still bound by space limitations. Going out and taking that step is still the subject of a domestic horror film. Secondly, the characters are distinct but not used. The carpooling group consisting of drivers, lost women, female lawyers, mother guns and long-legged girls is not bad. The driver is profitable, the biggest advantage is color; the mother gun is delicate and sweet, but timid and slightly clean; female lawyer on the surfaceIs a strong woman, but strong outside, is a woman with emotional deficits; a woman who is not only a choppy, but also a sorrowful woman, with the driver&#39;s eyebrows, apparently intended to spread the hormone effect in a small car; the most ink is the sporty long-legged beauty It is also a small three and divorce, but also rock climbing and suicide. It is a suspense, once a mysterious symbol in the car. If the film can solve the whole narrative problem in the five-member group, but the director obviously can&#39;t solve all the narratives between the five people, so the clues of the musician and her dancer&#39;s wife are introduced in parallel, and the result is still not enough. Also joined the smoke bombs linked to the two lines, a bloody Lin&#39;s strange rider. The problem is that since you have given each character in the car the corresponding character, it should be accompanied by their corresponding reaction in dealing with the crisis. Female lawyers must be strong everywhere. At a critical juncture, she should be allowed to pay for her vain temperament instead of simply panic. If a woman who is a woman fails to return to her peers, it will be a constant conflict with female lawyers. At the same time, you should also be a good companion, if this is not the case, the front of the paving will be meaningless; the sporty long-legged woman has just experienced the destruction of marriage, and the ex-husbandâ€™s life and death, the bag is still loaded The ashes of the ex-husband, and suicide in the bathtub half an hour before the trip, a desperate woman who is not afraid of death, in the face of horror, naturally there should be another set of behaviors different from ordinary people, but we did not see in the film... There are still a lot of slots, so I donâ€™t dig them all. Of course, Tucao is not my original intention. I have no intention of referring to the 100,000 yuan &quot;Tucao Fund&quot;, but more due to the good expectations of domestic films. Slots, let&#39;s take a look at the strengths of the film.",movie
945,"&quot;Terrorist Master&quot;, a total of two seasons, there is also a third season of &quot;Fear of Origin&quot;, which invites several sinister horror lords and new dignitaries to come and dedicate a thriller. The quality of the series is uneven. Not uniform, but for any enthusiast who regards John Carpenter, Toby Hob, Dario Aquito, etc. as an idol, &quot;who directs this episode&quot; seems to be more than &quot;what is this episode&quot; interesting. However, this is not the first time Carpenter and Hobberg have cooperated with Showtime. As early as 1993, the two had a TV movie with Showtime. This three-part horror short story called &quot;The Corpse&quot; It has been forgotten by many people, but its value is far more precious than &quot;The Master of Horror&quot;. It can even be said to be the prototype of &quot;The Master of Horror&quot;. Brian Collins&#39;s latest blog post happens to be the Blu-ray disc commentary of this film. Take the opportunity to simply write something to introduce this forgotten &quot;horror carnival.&quot; In fact, the &quot;corpse bag&quot; almost became a unit drama like &quot;Terrorist Master&quot;, but later Showtime intends to move the production location to Canada in order to save costs, but John Carpenter&#39;s own contacts and resources are in Los Angeles. The long-distance assignment was made, so the idea of â€‹â€‹making the series was eventually abolished. But fortunately, John Carpenter has already made two stories, and Toby Hob has also made one. So, the three short films have been integrated into a 90-minute TV movie, and through John Carpenter. The cute story of a dead corpse and the Tucao have led to these three stories. This narrative of the 80s horror drama &quot;The Legend of the Earth&quot; and the classic horror series &quot;Ghost Show&quot; is very terror. The appetite of enthusiasts is not only that, &quot;Lonewalker Luke&quot;, Roger Koeman, Wesker Ravin, Sam Remy, Toby Hob, John Carpenter and others are coming, so the luxury lineup is better than the lineup. The &quot;Terrorist Master&quot;, which is a half-baked master, is naturally easier for people to worship at the front of the screen. The last two stories don&#39;t really like it. Simply introduce the first story &quot;Gas Station&quot;, directed by John Carpenter, guest of Wesker Ravin and Sam Remy, a very traditional night murder story, but very chewable head. The film tells the story of a black-haired girl with a bee-shoulder and a buttocks who came to work at a remote gas station at night. This is the first night of her part-time job. She was shocked by the number of customers who were shocked and surprised. After, keen onThe perverted murderer who killed the woman officially appeared, and he turned out to be the male staff who had previously handed over to the female host. The original male staff member (Uncle Sam Remy starred) had already been killed by the murderer. The plot of &quot;Gas Station&quot; is very simple, but its agile soundtrack and cold and strange atmosphere make it easy to jump to Carpenter&#39;s classic &quot;Halloween.&quot; Or, it can be regarded as a small story that happened under the world view of &quot;Halloween&quot;. Carpenter seems to really want to have some kind of detached connection between the two. When the gas station killer climbed up from behind the black girl, the enthusiast wouldn&#39;t think of the screaming similar scene at the end of Halloween. &quot;Knowledge Bag&quot;, TV movie, produced by Showtime in 1993, developed by John Carpenter, is suitable for any American horror film brain powder that recalls the past.",movie
946,"In recent years, the TV drama market has continued to be hot, and the number of TV series produced every year has even exceeded the 10,000 mark. However, the quantitative change did not cause qualitative changes, and the screen was still full of spoofing through dramas, dramas, historical dramas, Lei Ren anti-war dramas and the introduction of co-productions. The plots such as the hand-tears, the prostitute heroes, and the mother-in-law fight also make the audience vomit and fatigue. At this time, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television issued a timely release, and announced the regulation and management measures for TV dramas broadcasted on the Internet as &quot;22 regulations.&quot; Not only does it control the number, time and channel of TV drama broadcasts, but the most important thing is to strictly limit costumes, cases, and dramas, and fully encourage real-life movies and TV dramas. A top-down TV drama innovation storm has been opened. Curtain. In the middle of this, the family idol drama &quot;The Return of the Golden&quot;, which is being broadcasted by TV, undoubtedly opened a &quot;cross-border&quot; door for the creation of TV dramas. Prior to this, the audience saw either a mother-in-law, a short family ethics drama in the parents, or a youthful idol drama of glamorous and handsome guys. There was no connection before. However, the TV series &quot;The Return of the Thousands of Gold&quot; has achieved &quot;the fish and the bear&#39;s paw&quot;, combining the handsome guys and the parents into a drama, so that &quot;the return of the thousand&quot; has youth idols, family disputes, emotional disputes, shopping malls The diversification factor will make the audience shine from the beginning. In fact, in recent years, there are many outstanding works of TV dramas in reality. Like the family conflicts, the &quot;Beauty Times of the Daughter-in-law&quot; and &quot;Golden Marriage&quot;, which explore social issues such as love, marriage, affection, filial piety and ethics, are all excellent. However, these hot-selling film and television dramas have followed the trend of the wind, and various &quot;good times&quot; have emerged, making the audience extremely aesthetically tired. This also reflects the lack of creative ideas for TV dramas from one aspect. In this case, &quot;The Return of the Thousands of Gold&quot; is a strong attack, combining family ethics and youth idol dramas together, creating a new way for the creation of TV dramas, and also making the theme of TV dramas innovate. The only contradiction in the life of the trivial, only handsome guys The beauty of the show lacks the soul. The innovation of &quot;The Return of the Golden Money&quot; gives the TV drama a sense of life. With contradictions and conflicts, it has a spiritual core, which not only extends the love and hate of the family and family, but also the joys and sorrows within the family. The blood conflict is the main narrative motivation, and it is a good blend of the characteristics of youth idol dramas. It uses idols to interpret youth stories and reflects the ideal love and survival status of the younger generation.The tension of the family ethics drama and the delicateness of the youth idol drama are perfectly integrated into one. &quot;The return of thousands of gold&quot; seems to have no wealthy family of rice, oil and salt, still can not be separated from the value and reason of ordinary people, Jiner reflects the moral and value forms under the theme of society, and reflects the change of moral value of society through individual family ethical issues. The girl who passed the pure sunshine finally defeated the black-faced stepfather to promote the positive energy of the society, let the youthful sunshine shine into reality, and raise the moral and ethical level of the whole society. Such a TV drama does not reflect life in a flat and camera way. Pay attention to the value and ideals cast into the depiction of real life. It is as grounded as a family ethics drama and as popular as a youth idol drama. Moreover, family chores, children&#39;s sentiments and youth idols have been brought together under the big theme of society, so that &quot;Golden Returns&quot; has become a public text reflecting social reality, which has complied with the audience&#39;s new psychological and cultural appeals. There is no doubt that realistic TV dramas should always dominate the mainstream of domestic TV dramas. Literary creation needs to embrace reality, and viewers need to draw positive energy from the &quot;second reality&quot; created by TV series. The national TV function management department attaches great importance to the promotion of realistic TV dramas through policies and regulations. Therefore, the reality TV dramas have flourished in the past two years. However, how to avoid the duplication of homogenization and how to open up new types of realistic themes is the long-term path for the development of Chinese TV dramas. The &quot;Golden Return&quot; has new ideas, new stories and characters in the breadth of content and the depth of meaning, fully demonstrating the great charm of TV dramas to realism, which is a step ahead in the creation of realistic TV dramas. .",movie
947,"The revolutionary past is a great movie. His influence can be seen everywhere in the movies of later generations. The romantic tendency of the film is unresolved, from the beginning of the symbolic lens to the various jumps in the middle and the first shot of the death penalty and the scenes of the prisoner or the flashback of the soft-mirror. The shadow of the film: Benigni or Jiang Wen or Neil Jordan, or a variety of new Western movies. From the ideology, this is a reactionary movie. The negative attitude towards the revolution, the revolution is often not a group of people with lofty ideals to overthrow the current politics, because the fruits of the revolution may fall freely in the hands of anyone, may be like a doctor to see the wind as a rudder, or other hidden behind the scenes but deep People with political savvy, may also be brave local tyrants like Juan, who have no revolutionary ideas, are used or who have entered the revolutionary team because of misunderstanding. Juan and the animal farm&#39;s nephew tell the truth: the revolution will not bring any benefits, and it is the key to making his own life, just to change the autocracy of a group of people to another group. Just as Juan himself is an example, he certainly does not have the lofty revolutionary ideals like John. He is a local tyrant and may be created by the chaos. Once he finally realized the political road, it was easy to suddenly usurp the fruits of the revolution and become the new target of revolution. After all, he did not believe in the revolution after he had no revolutionary ideals. Even if he used to talk about loyalty, he said that he was only for himself from the beginning. Profit. The course of the Mexican revolution also applied for such a statement, from Maduro to Vera to Carranza. The filmâ€™s denial of the revolution on the other hand is manifested by John. The revolution has friendship and betrayal, and the film also attempts to dispel the ideology of the enemy. Friendship and betrayal can be said to coexist. The film holds a certain sympathy and defense for betrayal. Although the friendship between Juan and John is eloquent, John experienced the betrayal and Juanâ€™s account of the revolution and the doctorâ€™s words, he said that he only believed in explosives. All the friendships and ideals of the revolution are unreliable. Only violence is real. After that, he even revolutionized the revolution and found his own way. This is because he walked too deep on the road of revolution, but he doubted the revolution and refused to turn back. But the film still does not get rid of the perspective and position of a revolutionary party, and still describes the revolutionary as an absolute enemy and machine. In fact, in those years of the Mexican Revolution, revolutionaries quickly became revolutionaries. The reason cannot simply be attributed to the fact that those who have revolutionary ideals have died in the revolution, and the fruits have been usurped by inexplicable people. Even JohnSuch a person is not dead. He only believes in the justice of the violence of explosives, that is, the justice of the revolution. Obviously, the film has more romantic heroic complexes for the revolutionary party&#39;s main characters, and the perspective cannot be separated from the revolutionary team. In addition, the revolutionary echelon is as sinful and unreliable as it is. Is it absolutely sin to be represented by the revolutionary government/fuss, and it is impossible to uphold a revolution that is not necessarily justice, and the revolution must be evil. Why is there such a large echelon to maintain the government/government and maintain the power? Only a naked massacre and repression is not a reflection of the revolutionaries. This perspective is biased. These problems, the performance of the film are not deep enough or even ignored. Of course, movies are not a philosophy, as long as they are better than others. If the day/toward someone who dares to shoot the same ideology of the same subject and hit the edge of the political/governing environment, he will surely achieve great commercial, social and reputational success. Of course, it is not necessarily true. Heaven is afraid that anti-revolution/life is better than red.",movie
948,"Seeing that the second generation of the rich is arrogant, the two are suddenly a little tired when they are both right and wrong. It may be that the climax and the end of the drama have arrived, but there are no new ideas or surprises. With a new understanding of the subtitles of the Hong Kong drama &quot;If there are similarities, it is purely coincidental&quot;, the similarity between the original drama and the drama has already deepened into the hearts of the audience. They also foresee that one day a certain audience can finally understand, so it is issued early. Disclaimer. Is the Hong Kong drama almost finished? Anyway, I looked a little bit of a panting weakness. Last year&#39;s two Taiwanese dramas were too positive and even bitter. Just like Feng Xiaogangâ€™s &quot;1942&quot; released at the end of last year, after all, he was unable to cater to the psychological needs of the public and was abandoned and criticized. This year&#39;s on call 2 begins with a tragedy, and even thinks that it is far-fetched when it comes to reluctantly calculating the warmth route; one of them has long known that everyone is sick, and the subsequent tone is not easy to go. &quot;French Extraterrestrial&quot; is therefore a highlight in the three series of last year and this year, which are unpleasant and fascinating. There has been no lack of humor to easily ridicule the elements of self-deprecation. Supervisor Xu Zhengkang is also good at this. Thirteen years ago, the old work &quot;Men and Girl Love&quot; is still proud of the tvb drama list. It is enough to show that he actually understands the audience. Although TVB dramas never lacked the second generation of arrogant and rich, but only when I saw Wang Haoxin this time, I silently lamented the success of the second generation. The background itself was once a son, and it may not be like this. The silky face is high and handsome. However, the characters in the opposite side are still not pleasing, although no one is throwing eggs at the actor on the street, but the advertisers will cancel the work of the actors. It is also said that the world is changing fast, and the change of concept is slower than a snail. However, this may also be another way to explain that Wang Haoxin has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. After the rape scene, Marseilleâ€™s blunt words are still difficult to remove, and I am afraid of Wang Haoxin. All these kinds of things, Wang Gongzi feels a lot of pressure on himself, and emotional illness also has a tendency to rise. At this time, it is better to think about the predecessors Tao Dayu and Wu Qihua. In fact, you only need a set of classic dramas and lovable characters. Of course, you can meet this opportunity to look at personal creation. Watching TVB, not talking about feelings is equivalent to talking about something less. I am very sweaty for the comrades of Comrade Yu Yingwei in the play. A man who wants to go back in 1981 is likely to reach the other side of the Love Sea. The barrister becomes a small man, and those childish and crazy moves, do you let you believe in love again? Unfortunately, the reality tends to be reversed, and the outcome is more likely to be &quot;to use all the strength but to exchange half-life memories.&quot;. Believing that love is not difficult, I believe that it is difficult for love to happen to oneself.",movie
949,"Buffy&#39;s wonderful destiny Barfi! (2012) The film tells the story of a dumb youth. The dumb man encounters a beautiful heroine in his hometown, so he does not care about the identity of the heroine who is about to get engaged, and strives to pursue her. After the heroine contacted the actor, she gradually fell in love with him, but after the mother persuaded the heroine to give up the relationship, she still married the unloved man and left her hometown. Subsequently, the male lead father was seriously ill, and he urgently needed money to cure the disease. The male protagonist could not take it out and had to plan to kidnap the daughter of the local rich with friends. Rich girl was familiar with the male protagonist from childhood, but she has autism, so she lives in a nursing home all the year round. This time, the rich girl returned home because her grandfather was ill and was summoned back. After a few days of grandfather&#39;s death, Grandpa left all his property to his daughter. At this point, when the actor was ready to take away the rich daughter, he found that her daughter had already disappeared. She had already been kidnapped by others. The male protagonist saw this and had to go to the bank the next day. However, when robbing the bank, the male protagonist was discovered by the inspector of the police station. When he desperately escaped, he just climbed the kidnapped car and met the rich daughter. So, the two happy to get along, then the hero also borrowed the rich daughter to get the money he needed, but unfortunately he was a step late, his father had passed away. The protagonist sent the rich girl back home, but the rich girl missed the actor and came back to him, just in time for the police chief to hunt down the male lead. In this way, the actor fled with the rich daughter, fled to the city where the heroine lives. After the actor and the rich girl arrived, the two found a job and a house, lived happily, and gradually fell in love with each other. One day, the actor met the heroine in the store, so the three of them met each other and happily got along. But because the actor is very enthusiastic about the heroine, the rich girl has left in a hurry. The male and female protagonists looked around for the rich daughter, but they had to go to the police station to report the case. The report soon attracted the inspector of the male lead in the hometown to arrest the male lead. The inspector quickly arrested the male lead. It turned out that the rich girl was once again kidnapped and killed. The heroine rushed to the police station in her hometown to accompany the actor to interrogate. At the time of the trial, the head of the police station wanted the actor to be a ghost. The inspector did not agree. He quietly let the heroine take the male lead. In this way, the heroine left her husband to live with the lost hero. After a while, the actor suddenly found a clue, so the male and female protagonists came to the sanatorium where the rich daughter had lived. Male leadI feel that the rich girl must live here, and she will attract the rich daughter in her childhood. It was her biological father who had kidnapped her daughter. He wanted to exchange cash, and the dean of the nursing home found everything. He then designed to let her daughter die, and then her daughter lived in the nursing home. After the truth, the actor and the rich daughter held a wedding, happy and happy life for many years until he died. All of the above are memories of the heroine. This is a long time movie and a complicated movie. But for me, the lengthy plot of the movie made me feel very boring. Because the plot in the film made me guess, there was no surprise. Although the film title is called &quot;Fantastic Destiny,&quot; I can&#39;t see how it is wonderful. Isn&#39;t it a cookie cutter with a love story in a kidnapping case, or can it be said that it is a kidnapping case in a love triangle? But no matter what, the various bridges and elements in the film are used in Hollywood, and people like me who watch a lot of people can&#39;t feel fresh. In short, my feelings about this film are just like the overall feeling of most of my movies recently?? Boring, lack of new ideas! Even if the film is good or bad, it doesn&#39;t mean this, but what does it mean to always repeat others? Of course, the filming is still very good. The director not only makes the story of the complex film clear, but also photographs its own characteristics, namely the beautiful picture and the moving music. These two points make the process of watching a movie very comfortable, especially the oil-like color, which is very pleasing! These two advantages also surprised me. I didn&#39;t think that Bollywood could even shoot a movie with this texture. They didn&#39;t just have singing and dancing performances. As for the music in the film, it is also different from other movies in India. The poetic and artistic atmosphere makes people easily immersed in the atmosphere of the film. So, although the plot of the movie is not good enough, it doesn&#39;t look tired because the film is too &quot;good looking&quot;. Finally, let&#39;s talk about the theme of the movie, that is, it has been smashed by thousands of movies: love, friendship, and no new ideas. In addition, there is a big loophole in the movie. Is India so economically developed in the 1970s? There are rich, rich heritage, and fashionable costumes. This obviously does not match the customs of Indians who donâ€™t rub their buttocks. Is the choreographer dreaming? The actor also calculates the color. The male lead Ranbir Kapoor is not handsome, but he plays the role through his eyes.It is obvious how good his acting is. Priyanka Chopra is not pretty, but it is a real act for an autistic girl and acting equally well. Actress actor Ileana D&#39;Cruz is a vase-style actor, and she can&#39;t see any acting skills except beautiful. Except for these three people, others donâ€™t feel anything, so they donâ€™t say it. in conclusion. This is a very ambitious film. The editor wants to express an epic, majestic love story through a complicated story, but it does not. Because of its shackles, the audience can&#39;t afford to be interested, even if the film uses a variety of shooting styles and styles. Barfi.2012.Blu-ray.720p.x264.DTS.MySilu",movie
950,"The 66th Cannes Film Festival is particularly interesting because of the &quot;Adol&#39;s Life&quot; and &quot;The Strangers by the Lake&quot;. In fact, European works of same-sex theme are everywhere, and it is nothing new to enter the Golden Palm. . However, same-sex topics are particularly sensitive in the context of the legalization of identity marriages in more and more countries. In particular, &quot;Adele&#39;s Life&quot; also won the Golden Palm Award. &quot;The Strangers by the Lake&quot; did not win such a privilege, but its limelight did not fall behind. With a simple picture and simple story style, this work has been successfully included in the â€œOne Concernâ€ module, and successfully won the Best Director Award, and the work itself has also won a unique award?? Comrade Golden Palm Award. The theme of comrades is prevalent today. On the one hand, it can be seen that the tolerance of the audience has become larger, and on the other hand, the scale of homosexuality has been growing and approaching the trend of confrontation with heterosexuals. French director Alan Jihoudi is good at filming such films. He has been in Cannes three times, but he is not familiar with most Chinese fans. I believe most viewers are not willing to know the director who is full of GAY. However, it must be admitted that the topic of stripping homosexuality, &quot;The Stranger on the Lake&quot; is still a strong personality film. The whole work is locked on the shores of the bright lake, and the simple lines outline the realism of the picture and the beauty of the body. Between men, the sway of the cover is not the &quot;desire&quot;, but the honesty of honesty. The plot of the work is also very simple, without fancy decorations, lyrical jealousy, and the entangled feelings between the two men are quite real through the straightforward plot. In addition to the simple plot, the way the characters are shaped is based on the principle of simplicity. The action of Frank, who came to the beach, was nothing more than chatting, hanging out, swimming, and voyeurism. The extra things were not done at all, and his friends and lovers had no extra drama except for killing and being killed. However, in response to a sentence, simplicity is not simple. Although the film is as simple as possible inside and outside, the shaping of the characters and the tension of the plot have not been weakened. Instead, there has been a simple and simple way of falsifying and bringing more vitality to the film. These are the parts that embody the director&#39;s skill. Through the details and framework, the director has narrowed the distance with the audience with a low-key intimacy, but this does not mean that the film is amiable. The most terrible part of the straight man is the shiny part of the film, which is the sex bridge that is similar to the burr. Be honest, all kinds of passion, meatI want to be stunned by the viewers (specifically, those who have never seen a work of the same kind, or who donâ€™t know much about Gayâ€™s behavior). The director did not deliberately choose an implicit way, but the straightforward picture magnified the most intimate part of GAY&#39;s sexual life. While watching the people who like it and others, the joy of masturbation; without the foundation of feelings, just hanging on the lakeside &quot;wild taste&quot;, the color of the grass is compelling and lingering; the scene of lovers caressing and intercourse is also close-up The way it is presented. If you are not mentally prepared, the &quot;simple&quot; general will not be able to withstand such a picture. Despite this, &quot;The Strangers by the Lake&quot; can not be classified as a physiological comfort item such as GV. The director used a cold color and various gloomy supporting roles to create an icy, oppressive atmosphere. The environment of the wild food should be ambiguous and stimulating, but it could not be seen in this work. The sense of oppression may be seen as a director&#39;s sorrow for the status quo of homosexuality. As for the emotional swing of a pair of lovers, it also becomes a sacrifice of environmental constraints. Interspersed with a pair of lovers, and a predecessor who was murdered shortly after the appearance. The selfish desire became an insurmountable gulf between lovers. The predecessor who died in the shadow of darkness followed Frank, letting him hesitate in the fear and greed of his lover. And the selfish desires that lovers do not hide are against the confusion and embarrassment of the protagonist. In the calm works of Poland, this contrast adds a valuable touch to the story. &quot;We did a very good job. It doesn&#39;t mean we have to sleep on a bed.&quot; Homosexuals are like duckweed, unable to fall into the roots. Even if they struggle to chase, it is difficult to hide the tragedy. It is better to face it. A cruel but realistic line seems to express the director&#39;s voice, which is very powerful, which also adds a lot to the quality of the film. Most European and American movies are based on the same-sex theme, and most of them choose to use literary temperament to render the film so that it does not seem unacceptable to the audience. There are also people who want to take real attention, but often fall into mediocrity and even vulgar because of the improper handling of themes or plots. &quot;The stranger on the lake&quot; obtained the effect of addition by the treatment of subtraction, which is a bold and mechanistic attempt by the director. For Cannes, who has always had a personality, it can&#39;t be said to be the best, but it is also good. The small success won in Cannes this time will probably bring a lot of motivation to the director. I donâ€™t know how far Alan Jihoudi can go on the simple rhythm. The same-sex theme and the style he created, with a big bureauLimitation and difficulty, the director has to make greater efforts to achieve further success.",movie

954,"The video is a trick, and the audience is only watching a lively event. Whoever can play tricks can easily earn a ticket. In the Hengdian Film and Television City, the anti-Japanese hero smashed the devil into two halves, and with the big screen, Raytheon hammered a mountain, there is no difference in essence. However, the former suffered numerous incites, while the latter was enthusiastically embraced. The key lies in the gap in operation. Hollywood uses its own scientific and technological means to blatantly confuse the boundaries between reality and illusion, and regards false itself as the pursuit of creation. Just add a layer of iron on the body of a person, or hold a hammer, you will become a superhero. The audience indulged in it, satisfying the self-centered pursuit of spectacle and dislike of mediocrity. Therefore, when &quot;false&quot; seems to be true than &quot;true&quot;, it is not a &quot;false&quot; problem, but a &quot;true&quot; problem. Hollywood superheroes can be roughly divided into three categories: First, the human body has the ability to surpass ordinary people by means of mechanical foreign objects, such as Batman, Iron Man, taking off equipment is ordinary people; second, the human body has undergone some ecological variation. Monsters, like birds and animals, come and go freely, such as the Hulk, Spider-Man; the third is the legendary people living in the heavens, such as Thor, Thor. These three heroes are increasing in skill, which makes the film more and more ambitious in the production scene, but it is inversely proportional to the artistic expression of the film. On the contrary, the first kind of hero who is close to human is more able to get a good impression. . The Nolan version of &quot;Batman&quot; is the best word of mouth in the Hollywood hero film. As for the purely sleek movie like &quot;Raytheon&quot;, it is no different from the nouveau riche and the local tyrant. After two hours of stimulation, there is left. The only thing that breaks down into flour is the exercise. The film series is a magic weapon for Hollywood to attack the city in the global market, but the sequel film often gives people a sense of continuation, and can not keep up with the first in quality. For many years, Hollywood has been able to rely on the sequel to award-winning films, with only one &quot;Lord of the Rings 2&quot;. Due to the lack of expression of the narrative and theme of the type of narrative routine, the sequel to win the audience&#39;s expectation is to achieve greater and stronger audiovisual effects. There is a long story in &quot;Raytheon 1&quot; that tells Troll that he has been in the mortal world and has a certain drama and comedy. And &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; is completely a contest between the two kingdoms in the universe. God and the devil come and go in heaven, and the status of the person is weakened. The SHIELD that appeared in the previous one completely disappears. Just rely on Natalie Portman to connect the plot. So the movie can let goThe design of the magnificent exterior of the heavens, the eye-catching giant weapons and the ugly appearance of the demon monsters, the scene is naturally more spectacular than the &quot;Raytheon 1&quot;. However, due to the addition of an &quot;Avengers League&quot; between the two films, people have seen pictures of multiple hero groups, and then return to this independent hero&#39;s film, it will not be enough. Since the mission of the superhero is to protect justice and life, although the two sides of the film are the power of the outer planet, but the final battlefield is on the earth, the human being hurt and saved will become the &quot;grounding gas&quot;. which performed. As a result, the building was destroyed, the crowd fled, and the sky-turning scene created a more realistic visual stimulus. If the battle is always carried out in the sky, the radiant mechanical weapons collide with each other. The audience is like watching a computer game, and there will be a sense of separation, which makes it difficult to project emotions. At the same time, in the aftermath of the bombing, the human vision is very easy to fatigue, this time the plot will be appropriate to add some humorous plots, warm-up or soft landing adjustment. The professors in &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; streaking, interns kissing and so on have played the role of a smile, but overall it seems empty and boring, compared to the iron man played by Robert Downey Jr., the comedy is not rich enough. When we made a box office for Hollywood and raised no nutrition, in fact, American experts are even more powerful than ours. Their favorite is the new Hollywood film of the 1970s, full of wisdom and humanistic care. Although today&#39;s blockbusters are dominated by superheroes, they are extremely rough in shaping, and their character is flat and singular. It is difficult to conquer the audience with the charm of the decoration. Thor Thor is undoubtedly a coward. Apart from picking up a hammer at a critical moment, it has no effect on the development of the plot. The uncharacteristic acting of the actor Hemsworth also expresses the meaning of &quot;developed limbs and simple mind&quot;. But it is this hammer that is the best way to solve the problem. Under the reward, there must be a brave man. Under the heavy hammer, there must be a coward. In the above episode, when Tol put the hammer on Rocky&#39;s body, he could not move. In the image, Loki&#39;s dark and gloomy is more flattering, and its transformation between true and false, good and evil is full of unpredictable mystery.",movie

In today&#39;s society where materialism is drunk, this is a warning that the voice in the movie is too weak, so I applaud you loudly, although it may still be disdainful by many fashion youths, because it is the most important thing as a movie. The guiding role has been ignored by the entertainment market for too long. Too many people have lost the ability to absorb spiritual food in the movie. Fortunately, I have seen that movies like you are still insisting. This movie is so powerful that I am like a silly smile and jealousy. The laughter is dense but never deliberate. The lyrics are concentrated on one point, so you can directly focus on the lacrimal gland. In addition to Pu Bajia, Zheng Haonan also has occasional hearings. Others are completely raw faces for me, but the directorâ€™s ability to control is really not covered. The skill of the actor to pinch the character is really appropriate and natural. It may not be appropriate to describe the savvy of the masters here. I just want to say that this is the most suitable way for Chinese movies.

Back of the item. I believe that you will never forget Helen Mirrenâ€™s last time to sweep the world with a big gun. This time, the â€œQueenâ€ is still the most eye-catching character in the film. He has repeatedly called the sulfuric acid to destroy the corpse and the flirtatious side. Slamming the Russian army&#39;s calmness, there are also many bridges that beat the agents.

958,"The gentleman is open and the villain is long. Long sly, often sad and troubled. There are no things much ado about. Lejia often finds troubles. However, as a villain and a mediocre, Lejia has become a strongman in many people&#39;s eyes. Successful people, why is this? Only in its true color, knowing me, only knowing me, I can move forward. Le Jia is looking at his own villain&#39;s heart and mediocrity. He constantly proves himself in humbleness and troubles. He surpasses himself and finally gets today&#39;s fame and fortune, and finally he is recognized by more people. Some people say that only the great hero can be true, and I can see that the non-big hero can also be true. And most of us ordinary people are villains who are smaller than Lejia, and mediocre people who are more mediocre than Lejia. Looking at Le Jia&#39;s &quot;Essence&quot;, you should be able to see some similar selfs? Can have this income, very good! &quot;The True Color&quot; says that it is me who is writing, and that is what you are saying; that the deeper the self-section, the more real you live. The eight characters on the back cover of the cover are basically the perfect evaluation of this book and Lejia, a true portrayal. In addition to the &quot;Self-Order&quot;, &quot;Postscript&quot; and &quot;Acknowledgment&quot;, &quot;The True Color&quot; has a total of 20 articles, and Lejia has developed an analysis of the self in an orderly manner. The rhetoric of his words is sharp and sharp, and his attitude is rigorous, objective, and meticulous. His purpose is pure and sincere, and he can feel deeply from the lines. Like Lu Xun, &quot;I don&#39;t want to try to figure out the Chinese with the worst malice,&quot; he &quot;does not describe himself and dissect himself with the worst malice.&quot; In &quot;The True Color&quot;, he &quot;has nothing to say to people&quot;. On the one hand, he is pursuing the true self with a true heart, and on the other hand, he is alerting the readers&#39; audience with the true state. This is a great benefit to others. Because of our current society, telling the truth seems to have become a shameful, stupid, hypocritical thing, and the celebrity stars under heavy packaging, if they want to tell the truth, or if they want to be said by people, Being the truth is a more difficult and difficult thing. Many people have become accustomed to the recognition that celebrities have been heavily packaged, and all behaviors and languages â€‹â€‹have a fixed pattern, which has been carefully modified; many people are more willing to think that their idols must be beautiful and not to be destroyed; Celebrities, fans of consumer celebrities, and onlookers all have a phenomenon from the bottom of their hearts: celebrities are not true. And Le Jia, to break this inherent cognition, he wants to tell people that he has his true color. The true color, keep it difficult, and show it harder! Not only is it difficult, but it also has to be a kind of sternness towards reality.Only in this way can we show the true, my own, pure nature. Le Jia talked about the scene behind &quot;You Are the One&quot;, talking about his own stage and talking about his own circle. He does not hide his own failures and frustrations when he first participated, and does not hide the helplessness and blame of editing the non-authentic Lejia for the needs of the program, and does not hide the joy and the sorrow when he is getting better and better. However, he will also cherish the friendship with Meng Fei and Huang Wei, and will also be grateful for the guidance of his own experience, and will also express the many people and guests who have shown the world. &quot;You Are the One&quot; has reded out Lejia, and Lejia has become an indispensable feature of &quot;You Are the One&quot;. Although the red is not much, but Lejia is not caught up in the whirlpool of right and wrong, but to maintain a true heart?? Let you make trouble, what to do with us. Le Jia talked about Weibo&#39;s bloody rain and talked about the value and positioning of fans. He is based on his own fans and experience with fans and many big V friends, telling fans that the big celebrities are ordinary people, fans don&#39;t lose themselves, open the celebrity skin, celebrities and fans are not much the difference. In addition, it is the hook-and-eye about forwarding and commenting. The interaction between celebrities and celebrities, the interaction between celebrities and fans, are all about fame and fortune everywhere, and there are always struggles. Although Weibo is small and complete, it is worthy of being a river on the network and a society in the network. Lejia pointed out Li Gui, who deceived his name. They used their name to concoct a plausible love chicken soup. In fact, they were essentially nonsense for fooling a fool. He showed his attitude towards doing things and his views on love, while pulling out those &quot;love maxims&quot; and criticizing them one by one. It may not be able to slap some readers, but at least it will have some vigilance. Le Jia talked about the past and present life of his own character, and described the process of his efforts and hard work in order to prove himself and fight for a sigh of relief. In fact, any successful person must be a person who is jealous of himself, and before he is jealous of himself, he may have encountered many embarrassment of others, such as contempt, insult, suspicion, etc. In front of these &quot;others&#39; jealousy&quot;, if you want to prove yourself, you must be jealous of yourself. Therefore, Lejia has proved himself by continuing to worry about himself, and he has admitted that he will have to turn over the serf. The pleasure of liberation also admits that he has the pleasure of revenge, but who is not? Moreover, after this, the mentality will inevitably continueMature, individuals will continue to grow. In &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot;, &quot;Inferiority&quot; and &quot;Self-esteem&quot;, Le Jia said that he was at the bottom of the society when he was in a state of incompetence, uncovering his bloody scars and telling us: Look, this is silk. Look, even if I am so successful now, I have been very silky; even if I seem to be successful now, but the mentality is still silk. He can lower his identity and put himself and more people on the same level, of course, in order to dissect the true self. In fact, it is also to give the reader a real and clear reference. I am also like this, you are the same, I Can be successful, you can also succeed. There are too many words in &quot;Natural Color&quot;, not to elaborate. Perhaps his essays are not beautiful, his views are not positive enough, and he often sells character color theory, but it can be seen that his attitude is absolutely serious and his purpose is absolutely positive. He lowered himself and did not hesitate to expose his own shortcomings. He did not hesitate to offend some celebrities to some extent. He just wanted to live a true color and show a true color. Even if it is not noble, it can be said to be true. The real person is lovely, the real person is credible. &quot;Essence&quot; makes Lejia cute and credible. Reading &quot;Essence&quot; makes people understand themselves more. This is really useful, true positive energy.",movie

Bob, who once had a brilliant career, now compromises the star of commercial advertising. Experienced the middle-aged crisis and reluctantly tried to balance love and family. Two people in Tokyo, spent a few days together, starting with a good feeling, ending in jealousy. A lot of people were moved by the film, and they wanted to come because they were all alone. Art needs to be substituted and recognized. When you look at their stories, you feel that you are talking about yourself. Is there anything more straightforward than this? At least someone is helping us to express it. A lot of moving details in the film. Bob took the drunk Charlotte back to the room, covered the quilt and gently pinched it on his shoulder. Insomnia night Charlotte went to Bob&#39;s room to watch a movie, two people chatting in bed, Bob stroked Charlotte&#39;s ankle. The expression of forbearance always enhances the realm of emotions, but it is beautiful. Most like the ending of the movie. I don&#39;t know what Bob said to Charlotte, but I hope that it is not a phone number or an address. It is best to say goodbye and become a shadow in each other&#39;s memory. After many years of thinking, I will doubt whether these are true. It happened. Life opportunities are always divided and harmonious, and goodbye can always comfort people. I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.",movie
960,"I have read this book for at least 20 years now, yes, I saw it when I was in elementary school. Itâ€™s still reopening it now because I recently mentioned this book with some friends who played jade. The book describes the knowledge of jade. Like the first textbook of enlightenment, let us unveil the veil for the first time to understand this. Thousands of years of beautiful things that make people dream. This book made me know for the first time that Zheng He is an eunuch, a Hui people, formerly known as Ma Sanbao, Zheng is the surname of Yuci; the first time I knew that there is a master in the history called Lu Zigang, his works not only let Later generations worshipped countless, and also let the people of Daiyu have the honor of falling on the jade; know the jade?, understand the charm of the ancient jade, but this book misleads me, let me really think that a piece of jade The value of the truth is the most important, and later I learned that there are many price factors for jade, and a writer can understand that these are also enough for homework. People who like jade will be more willing to read the story about jade. The girl who is less or less is a simple and pure love emotion that is influenced by the girl&#39;s feelings. And now I read it, there is a feeling of a goose bump layer. This book is undoubtedly good, and the Mao Dun Literature Award is not given casually. However, Shiyi has moved from time to time, and the ages have changed. The people and things that have come into contact have changed a lot. Rereading this book feels a lot of sentimentality. The story extends from the two lines before and after the liberation, and the authors created it in the 1980s. The tone of the description was also in that era, and it was necessary to write the characteristics of the times of the 1960s. The figures of all classes and the era were relatively simple. In simple campus life, the author sometimes describes the simpleness of enjoying campus love, so that I am now reading the cold, we have long been accustomed to such writing methods, and narrative methods. Because now we don&#39;t talk like this, so we accumulate emotions. The part that was written more successfully was the bloody hurricane of Han Ziqiâ€™s young teacherâ€™s art and self-employed family. Han Xinyueâ€™s twisted and euphemistic love story always felt that it was a burden, and the love of the new moon could not be said to be vigorous and eloquent. What is involved is the national problem and the entanglement between the emotions of the parents of the previous generation. It is better to say that the Chinese are older than the Koreans but later than the Japanese, ending a love with a disease that cannot be countered, making people sigh, But after the sigh, it passed. I believe that if the film and television industry developed a little more, and found a good screenwriter into a TV series, the ratings would be higher. In that era, Shilan Bu was a beautiful woman, but unfortunatelyIt is estimated that few people have seen the movie. Or in fact, the emotions and narratives described by writers of that era can only be adapted to the people of that era, and they are written farther, because what we have not experienced is rather handy, so that everyone prefers, and the middle is combined with timeless Collection, or the collection of ancient jade, I want a essay textbook, which gives many people the initial collection and appreciation of jade.",movie
961,"This is a revenge journey that is carefully planned for the sake of family because of the shadow of the boy. Who is controlled or counter-control? In the end, you will not know the ending. The film &quot;Control&quot; brings together two actors who have just been born as fathers and mothers? Wu Yanzu and Yao Chen, in the film, they play a pair of companions, and a lovely son. From the very beginning, the film gave the audience a set, so in the second half of the cycle, Wu Yanzu dictated the truth of this revenge story. The story spans two stages of juvenile and adult, and the four men led by Wu Yanzu fight for the revenge of planning for a long time. The opening of the film gives a modern sense of technology, and the towering city is decorated with blue to create an avant-garde sense of future technology. The mobile phone used by the actors in the film is actually a transparent mobile phone, which is much higher than the Apple mobile phone. With the development of the story, the original directorâ€™s intention was not to create a story full of science and technology, but to return to reality and show stories about human weakness. In order to let his mother enter the quality of the nursing home, Wu Yanzuâ€™s actor Mark has not hesitated to make false testimony for his insurance company and was threatened by the â€œmysterious personâ€ to steal huge sums of money from the bank. In a series of &quot;forced&quot; actions, Mark has been on the verge of control and counter-control. In other words, the &quot;mysterious man&quot; has unscrupulously instructed Mark to let Mark escape from this control. Mark also found that the original &quot;mysterious man&quot; did not just manipulate him, but also appeared multiple characters. The first half of the whole story has been deeply immersed in an unsolved mystery. Who is the &quot;mysterious person&quot;? These people, as &quot;chess pieces,&quot; were forced to the brink of despair under the control of &quot;mysterious people.&quot; As a result, the characters played by Shao Bing changed this pattern. Although this character died in the shooting, it has become a crucial transition point for the film. The setting of this character caused a reversal of the control and control of the film. The villain in the film is a leading group of gangsters, led by Ren Dahua, and the role played by Dai Liren becomes the most important part of the film. The story is also narrative by Mark&#39;s self-reported tying down by the brothers. The opponent in the play does not show a very evil side. On the contrary, the villain in the whole film can even calm down and listen to Mark&#39;s self-report. Here People can&#39;t understand, the impression of the rogue gangster image is not so vivid in the film, just just interspersed in the story into Dai LirenThe ruthlessness and cruelty of the gangsters. Finally, under a burst of gunfire, a group of gangsters were shot and killed. Mark&#39;s mother lived in a paradise-like nursing home under the protection of a large number of children, adding to the theme of &quot;invincible&quot;. However, the film is not that simple. At the end of the film, whether it is a villain or a decent party, the identity of these characters has reversed. The whole film is not only a law-abiding &quot;gangster&quot; police film, but also incorporates the elements of &quot;reversal&quot; and makes the audience on the scene a &quot;chick&quot;. It turns out that everything is not so simple, and control and control are not that simple. The role played by Dai Liren was finally revealed his true identity. It turned out that he was the &quot;mysterious person&quot; of the film. It was his interest to control and explore the heart. Therefore, Mark and others became his &quot;hostage&quot;. For its benefit. However, the drama is that Mark is not a simple &quot;pawn&quot;. He and Yao Chen, played by Yao Chen, carefully designed the counter-control drama of the Central Bureau, so that Dai Liren easily believed them and eventually got Due punishment. Mark and other people were originally children of the mother who was mad by Dai Li. In order to revenge, they jointly designed the mystery of this deception, and finally made their plans. Throughout the story, control and counter-control, manipulation and manipulation, the characters have undergone subtle changes in the play, and the truth revealed at the last moment of the film has brought the final truth of the film to the surface. The city in the film is placed in a virtual space in which the weaknesses of sin and humanity are manifested by the imperial concubine. Therefore, in the movie, many unreasonable things become reasonable. The mark played by Wu Yanzu is the party to be controlled and the party that controls people. In the &quot;control of the city&quot; full of control, anyone is one of the pieces. The opposite location is home to Mark&#39;s childhood memories, where there are no tall buildings, some are just beaches and seas, and the family he loves, but the location of this memory is destroyed by the darkness of reality. . Being in the &quot;control of the city&quot; is not the original intention of a group such as Mark. For revenge and for the mother, they have to choose another violent means to bring the people who deserve it to justice. It can be said that all this is the mark that Mark pedestrians have seized the weakness of human nature and carried out the Jedi counterattack. Whether it is Dai Liren of the gangster or Mark of the decent side, although they all know that they are grasping the weakness of humanity and controlling it, they are allThe ruthless suppression of the meeting changed helplessly. From the innocence of the juvenile to the sleekness of the world after entering the society, their appearance is changing and their hearts are changing. Therefore, when they are still young, the collective photos are on the lens, which is undoubtedly a kind of memory for the pure world. The madness and madness of the mother (Hui Yinghong) is the ruthless irony and disguised emphasis on this society. Despite this, whether it is human sin or a mystery, the film finally returns to the essence of family, and ultimately it is because of love, defeating all sin and darkness, and heading for a bright future. For the director, &quot;Hainan Chicken Rice&quot; should be one of his most famous works. Bi Guozhi&#39;s depiction of delicate emotions and life-like plots is his best part. &quot;Control&quot; can be seen as the first work of its turn to commercial gangsters to warn the blockbuster. Although there was a &quot;shooting fire&quot; written in collaboration with Lin Huaquan, the narrative of the story in this film directed by him, the plot The control is not yet familiar, and the logic of the story is not too strict, not its best work. The theme of the film &quot;Control&quot; is relatively new, and the final reversal of the storyline makes people shine. It can be said that although there are many deficiencies and logical problems, it can still be seen, it is worth encouraging!

964,"Cui Yuzhiâ€™s acting did not have to say that the first imprisonment of this kind of thing is the most devastating one after another. When you spend the painful anger or self-exile, the day before you wake up and wake up again I will meet you the next day of the crash. Year after year, don&#39;t let you commit suicide, you won&#39;t be mad, hypnotize you to treat you. . . Then the body survived and the spirit rotted. At this time, I thought, should I thank you for cultivating a decadent and drunken uncle into a super-powerful madman for 15 years. Jiang Huizhen&#39;s chest is pretty, I like the kind of madness and sensuality that she plays. (I donâ€™t think there is much disgusting in the power of the bed-playing drama, such as Song Kangxi in the bat, the uncleâ€™s uncleâ€™s bed scene is amazing and there is a feeling of strength... and the opponents are all good-looking women) I probably still don&#39;t understand the story. Is it what I think? The soundtrack is so troublesome, there is a feeling of urgency, hehe. Itâ€™s not like Park Chan-yu. The crime film is more artistic than the erotic film, and the old face is red. It is so cute that Jiang Huizhen learned how to pray in the painting. Hypnotic fruit is really dangerous behavior. Finally, the bad guy&#39;s gift is very amazing and very shocking. It is completely a knife inserted deep into the man&#39;s eyes. Then the male owner&#39;s series of acts like self-injured glass is even more shocking. Only the soundtrack has no dialogue. Actually, I felt that my heart was calm, although at this time the male actor Wu Daxiu was caught by the white hair Han teacher. . It seems that I saw that the original director wanted Wu Daxiu to know the truth and then cut it off, but it was really powerful to be changed to cut tongue by Cui Yuzhi. It made me think of the tongue, because the long tongue of the young age led to the current tragic situation. what. At the moment when the button was pressed, Wu Daxiu thought that he could end the life of the bad guy. He did not expect to be defeated by an army. He was once again castrated by the spirit. Even if I am a beast, is there no qualification for survival?

967,"Traveling, reading books, watching movies, and running seem to be the four major hobbies in my daily life. The latter three have done a good job of themselves. Travel alone seems to be a demanding thing in life. What is the reason, naturally money and time. Especially time. I agree with the words in the author&#39;s book. Travel allows me to truly feel the world, movies, and tell me that the world has unlimited possibilities. But I know that the world is infinite, but I can&#39;t really feel it. In fact, this is the responsibility of the responsibility, when the author asks others &quot;Is it wrong?&quot;, the author also wants others to give him a satisfactory answer to let him continue to do, but some very realistic answer is that you should have one A more responsible life, for yourself, for your parents. Ok, I am also more inclined to this answer, so I can&#39;t live the author&#39;s fascinating life, and tourism can&#39;t be an important part of my life. It doesn&#39;t matter, you can feel it in the book. The author of the book explains many ways to save money. For example, taking a night-night car can save a day&#39;s accommodation costs. For example, if you can walk, you will not take the bus. For example, in the first two days of Paris, you only eat a pound of chicken wings and a few slices of bread from the Netherlands, but these small Little hardships and tribulations have become valuable life treasures. Regarding the travel notes, the author thinks that the writing can be divided into two types. The first one writes his own story, tells the time, place, character, what he ate, and what he did. This travel should be done on the go unless you have great memory. Otherwise many details will soon be blurred. Another type of travel is to write stories of others, such as stories of cities in travel, stories of people who meet, which can evolve into stories of art, stories of culture, stories of history. Three points of experience in self-help language: First of all, English must be good. Secondly, it is best to learn a few local languages. The final ultimate weapon is a smile. There are always many unexpected encounters in the journey, either people, or things. The yearning for and expectation of the unknown makes the author unable to extricate himself during his travel career. Different places have different stories, situations and cultural backgrounds. People are placed in it and are deeply influenced. Travel offers the possibility of getting in and out of different living conditions of different nationalities in different countries. This very different life state has enriched the journey and is one of the reasons why Xiaopeng is addicted to the journey. As for the self-help tour, Xiaopeng has his own interpretation. Many people think of self-help travel and immediately think of suffering. Self-help travel should be a personalized experience of increasing experience in Xiaopeng.The solution to the life, the words flowing in the pen and the photos taken will have a deep meaning. From hardship to pleasure, professional travelers must fully experience it. The bitter place is hard to eat, and you should enjoy it when you enjoy it. For example, in Milan, Xiaopeng saw the home game of the world&#39;s top powerhouse. For example, in Vienna he went to the Golden Hall. If you encounter a unique luxury hotel in the world, he will not miss it. He called such a trip an experiential trip. That is, if you haven&#39;t seen it before, you won&#39;t have to play it. If you spend more money, he won&#39;t be embarrassed. If you try it, you can taste it. Even the best night in the hotel will make the marginal benefit diminish. Experiential travel The logical relationship between scenery, money, and time is that you must first look at the best scenery, that is, seeing what you have not seen before, eating and not eating, playing unplayed. Under this premise, spend the least amount of money and time. Xiaopeng also concluded that travel should be aesthetics, architecture, history, and should never be economics. If you go to France if you turn around in Paris, then we circle around the earth, where is it used for $3,000? The city is Yangshuo. Xiaopeng wrote that Yangshuo is such a place, it is easy for people to put down their guards to get to know strangers. Leave your worries and let yourself indulge in the bar music, in the afternoon sun, in the quiet old streets. Barcelona, â€‹â€‹the city of GaudÃ­. The Japanese Shishan Xiuwu interprets the Sagrada Familia as a deified world sealed by modernism. The deified world is connected to the modern world through ruins, and the Sagrada Familia is such a living ruin. The young man from Argentina who met in Andorra gave Xiaopeng a new perspective on travel. Before, he thought that travel was just eating, drinking, and playing. After that, he thought that travel was a normal process of integration with local people. The Vatican talked about religion. Western religions have the original sin, life is evil, the human heart is dark, and you need to control your own desires, so the church will have a confession room, the role is to make people always introspect. And the continuous introspection will gradually accumulate into the habit of life, will be kind to people, calm things. Another issue of religious settlement is how to treat death. All the great spiritual systems in the world tell us that death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of a new journey. Whether or not there is a belief, as long as it can be self-sustaining, controlling desire, being kind and not greedy, what is said is a positive attitude towards life. Xiaopeng concluded by summing up: &quot;Faith is only a kind of practice in the heart of the individual. After 10 years of backpacking, I have walked too many churches, temples, mosques, and religions.I also know that from the initial unbelief to the present, although I still donâ€™t believe it, I believe that faith is better than unbelief. Because religion can solve some problems that plague the mind, people can live a cleaner life. In fact, travel has become a kind of faith for me. We are all on our own pilgrimage road. &quot;This paragraph gives me a different understanding of religion. On the international express train from Marseille to Geneva, Xiaopeng met a French old man. He heard that he wants to go to Switzerland to see the snow-capped mountains. Obviously he is very interested in travel. Then, I will talk about all kinds of interesting experiences of traveling around the world when I was young. Finally, young people, people only live once, there are too many places you have not been to, too many scenery you have not seen. Must I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a white job. Xiaopeng said, it must be. Finally, Xiaopengâ€™s sentence was very impressive. â€œI always need a leader in my life. I am very lucky. When I met him, I still young. &quot;There is also the vice president who said to him: &quot;You are 26 years old, no longer young, choose a career, you must persist, in order to achieve something.&quot; It is his words that made Xiaopeng firmly follow the path of travel. I was thinking about me, I was even younger, I have not met my own leader, and no one told me to teach me how to advance. I am not very unlucky. In Geneva, Xiaopeng encountered a customs search for naked body. In the journey, such unfortunate things are actually quite a lot, such as being stolen, deceived, and robbed. The most dangerous one, Xiaopeng and robbery I spent a minute in the middle of the street! After thinking back and forth, he admired his courage and was a little scared. In fact, as long as people are still there, everything can be started from the beginning, no big deal. Of course, people canâ€™t always be unlucky, in Nice. He has encountered the selfless help of the kind old lady. He is often unselfishly helped by all kinds of people in his travels. The best way to return is to pass on this love and help more people. Because love is a kind of energy that can be recycled, find love in travel, pass love, should this be the belief of every traveler? I think this is necessary. Xiaopeng also lived in the ancient city of Lijiang for two months. In the days, he did not go to Yulong Snow Mountain, did not go to Humin Lake, and stayed in the ancient city. Every month, the cost of accommodation, meals, and Internet access was RMB 800. Life was simple. Read novels, go online, and walk from Fulin. Going to the stone archway and going back from the archway. I think this kind of life is not good. Itâ€™s not easy. Itâ€™s simple for Xiao Peng to be synonymous with freedom. He moved several times in Beijing, and itâ€™s only simple.Baggage, the most books, clothes and shoes are not many, the requirements for the new home is simple: clean, have a desk, can take a bath, can access the Internet. In fact, I feel that if I am alone, it will be easy to live. The articles about Vietnam let me know the city of Hoi An. I have traveled through Saigon and learned some history of war. In Tibet, I wrote down some suggestions for his altitude sickness: 1. Take the plateau Rhodiola at least 10 days in advance. 2. On the first day of entering the plateau, don&#39;t eat too much. 3. Do not stay overnight in the area above 4,500 meters above sea level on the first day of entering the plateau. 4. Unless you are dying, it is best not to take oxygen. 5, insist, must insist, no big deal. These are the personal experiences of Xiaopeng after suffering a painful altitude sickness. I think it is much better than some unexplored photos. Of course, in the night of Namco, Xiaopeng came to the lake alone. Because the heavens and the earth were too quiet, I could hear the breath of the lake. Hehe...hey...he has a fixed frequency. Listening and listening, people seem to enter a state of being settled, and the heart becomes as transparent as the lake. This is the reason why Xiaopeng stayed in Namu to miss the night. Even if he was hungry and cold, even if he was robbed by the altitude sickness, he could get a rare clean. There was also a nude photo of the back on the second day. In fact, he was not the first time in the natural world. He was in the top of Mount Wutai, and later in the Sahara Desert. In the South Pacific Island, he used the most sincere body and most Pure natural skin is close to each other. Because of freedom, there is no bondage. This makes me yearn for. When describing the Indian tour, Xiaopeng showed me different aspects. The first is to kill customers, such as the Taj Mahal, Indians only need 30 rupees, while foreign tourists want 750 rupees. When Xiaopeng arrived in New Delhi, he met three kinds of people who slaughtered customers. &quot;Hello Mr.&quot; at the airport, &quot;Mr. Driver&quot; who often gets lost and does not speak English, and the travel agency is warm and thoughtful to help you to call the &quot;Mr. Milk Tea&quot;. Their purpose is to earn high hotel rebates. There are also some Indian businessmen who are also very good at playing dozens and dozens of tricks in English. If you want to save a little bit of fairness and justice in your travels, you must try your best to understand the local price standards, practice the skillful price-killing skills, and have a quick self-treatment after being deceived. The tough heart. In fact, India is like this, and it is everywhere. In fact, it was the super overload. Xiaopeng was anchored on the way to the car. The driver was very powerful and stuffed all the passengers in the car.Another car is also full of cars. The use of overload to describe is obviously a big word, Xiaopeng is standing in the position of one foot on the other, just like floating in the air. In addition, there is the strange mouse temple and the bus trip in Kolkata, the bus with the thief, this is also the unforgettable experience of Xiaopeng. However, Xiaopeng&#39;s evaluation of South India is not bad. He feels the enthusiasm in human nature, which is in stark contrast with the cities in New Delhi and Mumbai that are ridiculous. In Nice, France, there is a top resort called Negresk, which attracts many celebrities to stay here. Apart from the aristocratic service here, the court of the room, and Michelin, there is also an important reason why it is arranged here. It&#39;s too much like a museum, and there is no fake. This hotel can also cater to the preferences and habits of each guest, which is also a magic weapon for this hotel. Not only a good reputation, it is also a legendary hotel. Xiaopeng once heard that Bill Gates wanted to buy this hotel a few years ago, but no matter how much the price was offered, the old lady was unmoved. After understanding the story behind it, Xiaopeng understood two things. One is that no one wants to change his home into a check, and the other is that every piece of art is invaluable. Xiaopeng Wenchuan also went to Sichuan during the earthquake. Of course, it was not a tourist. It was a volunteer. Although he did not go to the front line, he also saw a lot of things. The sentence he wrote was good. The so-called strong, not crying in the face of natural disasters. But to face it later with a smile. I think this is what he learned from Wenchuan. For tourists, taking pictures is naturally essential. There are not many times in the book to talk about photos. The time in Mengwei Village in Laos is very meaningful. Xiaopeng washed out the photos of the children he photographed. I sent them to them because they were photographed every day, but they didn&#39;t necessarily have a photo of themselves. It was a very happy thing to send photos. The children followed him. Xiaopeng said that he was like a king waiting to be crowned. So even if we can&#39;t leave photos of difficult areas like Xiaopeng, let the children see a warm smile behind the camera. Also, Xiaopeng feels that photography should be like writing, a record of what he sees in a flash, a record of a person&#39;s growth, and never pursue the majority. In the section on the French dinner, I saw that I was drooling. Xiaopeng believes that food is an important part of travel. From the roadside to the top, he always does not refuse. If you ask him which country&#39;s favorite foodHe will not hesitate to say the meal, because he can always bring surprises. After ten years of backpacking, Xiaopeng discovered that his friends have been all over the world. No matter where they go, they are no strangers. Wherever they go, they are home. And the cities and countries that have passed have become different because of the existence of friends. But getting it also means losing. When most of the wife and children are hot-headed, he may be sleeping in a corner of the world, giving up the comfort for his dreams. Xiaopeng said that if he would feel a little shy, he just felt particularly sorry for his parents, they were traditional people, and he hoped that he would live a traditional life, and his rushing away from them made them always worried. We are seeing the glamorous side of Xiaopeng&#39;s tourism, and also see the tragic experience of his journey (such as sleeping with a thief, passing the customs off) and what he has lost. I think that every article in this book is very exciting and very patient. For every place he walks, whether it is his jealous person or thing, or the local scenery, humanities he introduced, or the local information he introduced. I like it all the history. He also benefited a lot from his feelings during his travels. He has greatly expanded my concept of tourism. I think tourism is no longer as simple as eating, drinking, or living. It is life, culture, history, and Feeling. Thank you for this book, I will continue to watch his work.",movie
968,"Director Jiang Chengâ€™s &quot;Step by Step&quot; is a good doctor who was accidentally brought into a series of murders. Behind the facts, this is just the inevitable result of the implementation of a manic concept. The frightening atmosphere created by this film is really powerful, and some politically incorrect, that is, women are basically dead, no matter how good or bad, which creates a lot of eroticism, desire and killing. However, the film still has certain advantages in the production environment in the Mainland. People who use &quot;magic bullets&quot; are also in the psychedelic. Zhang Ruyi became the new dean and continued his ambition. His dream was to invent a drug that could control the spirit and will of the people, and then eliminate the killings and wars and achieve world peace. This &quot;Hitler-style dream&quot; seems so ridiculous in this era, but when the dean in the anamorphic lens trains all the medical staff, more than a hundred people say &quot;Please go well!&quot; &quot;I wish you health!&quot; The shadow of the &quot;third wave&quot; is similar to the performance in &quot;Inspur&quot; (2008). However, a closer look, from the &quot;Falungong&quot; in 1997 to the &quot;Almighty God&quot; in 2012, all with the banner of peace and eternal life, confuse people and walk the road of demons in the name of God. For his so-called dream of peace, Zhang Ruyi tries to control the spiritual will of the people, does the experiment with the patient, and does not care about life and death. It is no different from these cults. The impression of &quot;low cost, small investment, and big money&quot; for domestic horror movies outside the industry should be said from Forrest Gump. In 1999, A-Gump photographed the first &quot;terrorist&quot; movie &quot;Ancient Mirror&quot;, which invested 5 million yuan, and achieved a box office of 11 million. It was regarded as a box office miracle in that year. In 2001 and 2002, A-Gump had two â€œterroristâ€ films, â€œThe Ferocious Fierceâ€ and â€œGhost of the Haunted Houseâ€, which were invested in 1 million and 2 million respectively. Although they suffered â€œbad commentsâ€, the box office reached 13 million and 1500 dollars. However, the discerning person knows that no matter what type of film, the investment cost is not the deciding factor of the box office. The most recent craze was the &quot;Midnight Taxi&quot; (2009) hot sale five years ago, with only a few million dollars in winning investment. However, nearly one hundred horror films released since then, in addition to &quot;Crysis of Far Cry&quot; (2011) with Yang Mi&#39;s appeal to obtain a high-margin box of 90 million yuan, the rest are almost low box office, poor reputation, praised the plot is rough, the setting is rough. The bad plot is the lack of skill in the editing, and the rough setting is not enough for the production. Before &quot;Step by Step&quot;After 17 revisions, it is truly logical and not vulgar. At the same time, in order to get rid of the shackles imposed by the small-cost investment in the thriller, the investors spared no expense, and enabled the 3D shooting team to take real shots with more than double the input of the domestic domestic thriller, aiming to create an immersive and legendary 3D. horror film. In order to create the most horrible audio and video effects, the &quot;3 Steps to Catch the Soul&quot; film has invited the professional 3D special effects production team in China to create the first 3D thriller in mainland China. The horror effect is indeed unmatched by ordinary 2D thrillers. . In addition, the film&#39;s unrestricted pursuit of &quot;real&quot; viewing effect also contributed a lot to the bursting atmosphere. The first is to pay attention to the truth of logic. On the one hand, the film pays attention to setting up coincidence and bizarre. On the other hand, it combines these coincidences and bizarreness into the reality of life. For example, for the sake of truth, the crew enters the hospital. Shooting on the ground, and outpatient wards, inpatient wards, toilets, bathrooms, test tubes, syringes, and other scenes and props all reveal a real and horrible atmosphere, which is really terrible. In addition, the film deliberately chooses the professions and groups such as hospitals and doctors, which fits the psychological presuppositions of the current public and the nervous doctor-patient relationship, thus creating a psychologically super-sense experience of â€œbeing aroundâ€.",movie
969,"The screen drama &quot;The Unique Hero&quot;, which is currently being broadcasted, is considered to be the best in the recent TV series. It is not because the Warriors are Lu people, they have a preference for the legend of their hometown. The source of the title of &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; should come from Chairman Mao&#39;s poem: &quot;The unique hero drives the tiger leopard, and there is no hero to fear the bear cub&quot;. In the chaotic era, there is a unique hero, save yourself and save the people and save the public. Cangsheng, the protagonist Ma Yulang evolved from a drama to an anti-Japanese hero, which is also caused by his character, caused by his life, and caused by current events. Although the overall look of &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; is a very inspirational element of the Weijia Baoguo dynasty drama, but personally think that this drama is more like a commercial drama, from the perspective of mining coal mines, to show the national TV audience The style of Lu Shang. As everyone knows, regardless of Huizhou merchants, Shanxi merchants, Zheshang merchants, and Cantonese merchants, as a regional business association with a long-standing reputation in China, in the different historical periods of China, they all had their own prosperity. In fact, the five major Chinese businessmen in general Help, in addition to the first four, there are Lu Shang. According to the test, Lu Shang began in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, formed in the Spring and Autumn Warring States, matured in the Han Dynasty, and developed and improved in different historical stages. Of course, today&#39;s so-called business gang has long since lost its style. Zheshang mainly attacked coats and shoes, and Jinshang became a world-famous Tufuhao by digging coal. But through the &quot;Unique Heroes&quot; we know that in fact, since ancient times Shandong is one of the most important coal production bases. Zaozhuang Coal Mine had a record of mining as early as 1880. It was one of the most important coal producing areas in the country in the 1980s, and even today it is still being mined. This is a later statement, press the table. However, as the first TV series about the business of Lu Shang in recent years, &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; is still very unique. This drama not only shows Ma Yulangâ€™s business experience, but also through the development of the plot. It is more objective to restore the characteristics of the commercial city in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Besides, the hero of &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; was around Monday. It was a Wusheng, but because of the sudden serious injury of his fatherâ€™s horse three jumps, he went to the Zaozhuang from the provincial capital Jinan, and this did not matter, the two complained. All disappeared, and the former suspicion was released. Of course, when Ma Yulang yelled at his fatherâ€™s stage name, Ma Santuo left the world. For a moment of life and death, the next wonderful story of &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; was born. In addition to the actor&#39;s Monday round, the other actors in the show are also very good, except for the big villain who played the eye of the audience from the first scene, Ni Dahong, and Ma Yulang&#39;s lover in the troupe, Li Xiaoyu.Other major actors who have appeared in the show are Bao Beier, Xue Jia Ning, Yu Mingjia, Lin Yuan, etc., which are also unforgettable power coffee. &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; is not a play that advocates and promotes individualism. Although the male protagonist Ma Yulang has stringed up the whole legend, but through the whole article, this is undoubtedly a group of works, big goose, Bai Shuangfeng, pink butterfly, etc. Etc., after the artistic processing of the abstract group of people, all the characters are outstanding, the image is clear, although the drama is more than a hundred years old, but now it seems that there are many empathy places, all kinds of children are very long, quite sad . &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; spans time and space for decades, and the most important artifact that runs through the whole drama is the coal mine in Zaozhuang. Therefore, despite a lot of historical wars, life and death, the core of the whole drama is still how to deal with coal. The development and application of precious mineral resources, from the early manual excavation of hand-shoulders to the modern excavation, a coal mine is also the epitome of the motherland in the swaying state, whether it is the local kiln, the greedy warlord, or The colonial business group from overseas, all of them love this magical black burning stone, and want to do everything according to their own methods. Therefore, &quot;The Unique Hero&quot; is not so much a business developed and protected by the coal mine. The drama is as good as seeing it in the small and big, and seeing the drama of China in Qilu. In the small place, Ma Yulangâ€™s inspirational inspiration can be seen. It is obvious that the national backbone that has made Chinaâ€™s rise rise is very useful.",movie
970,"&quot;Step by step chasing soul&quot; in this year&#39;s horror film camp, because it is the only 3D stereoscopic film, and it is particularly prominent, the horror film to play three-dimensional, destined to be sang to let the audience of the theater scream, The immersive feeling of a three-dimensional movie can be used most effectively. Of course, the film is indeed as the title says, step by step is amazed, always dangerous, the film&#39;s leading actor Zhou Wei, not only on the road to be chased by the soul, but also chasing him, not only some people, but also like ghosts The shadows exist. The film seems to be chasing the soul step by step. In fact, it is a step by step soul chase. The battle of the soul is the greatest enemy of a person. Whether it is a self-generated &quot;mind&quot; or an external &quot;invader&quot;, it is not controlled. The purpose of the mind is, therefore, the ultimate source of fear, from the heart, the battle with fear, is also the struggle with the self, at least in &quot;step by step chasing the soul.&quot; The story of &quot;Step by Step Chasing the Soul&quot; is very clear. The generalization of one sentence is: anti-&quot;control&quot;, tracing the truth, yin or screaming, or escaping, to get rid of the manipulation of the invisible hand. The film selection was released at the same time as Wu Yanzu and Yao Chenâ€™s annual masterpiece &quot;Control&quot;. In fact, the provocation is obvious, but this is the appearance, because no matter &quot;step by step&quot; or &quot;control&quot;, the basics are all about &quot; The story of &quot;control&quot; is controlled by psychotropic drugs, one is controlled by various cameras. Of course, the truth behind them is similar. There is a greedy person who controls the tools of governance. People always have such a Desire, or for money, or for freedom, if the behind-the-scenes in &quot;Control&quot; is just to play a few children, to make hundreds of millions of Hong Kong dollars, and more to focus on teasing games, then In &quot;Step by Step Chasing the Soul&quot;, this new big villain looks at the whole world and smashes the whole world. With the return of all human beings to the Nazi Utopia, the attempt to make the whole inner greed get an instant burst. Expansion is a terrible thing. The film starring Yuan Chengjie, is a popular film and television song, a handsome young man, and plays the doctor Zhou Wei in the film. It is a personal charm that brings a different look and feel to everyone. The hero and heroine of the conventional horror film is not too stupid, but it is self-righteous, and Yuan Chengjie is precisely the kind of man who is a weak person but is upright. In fact, whether it is a ghost that is unwarranted, or an evil that is visible to the eye, righteousness is The magic weapon to dispel all the dark clouds, so we can see that Zhou Wei is not big enough.Powerful, power is not strong enough, but in the critical moment of facing the gangsters, always with bravery and tact to save the risk. Of course, because he met all evil spirits, in the face of justice, this would be vulnerable. In the past, I rarely saw the film and television works starring Yuan Chengjie. I only knew that in the same year, he and the combination of male and female characters composed by Rose became one of the hottest combinations. The film, indeed, gives people unlimited surprises. Yuan Chengjie has vividly demonstrated the courage, sincerity and justice of the male protagonist, and &quot;Step by Step Chasing&quot; as a film with erotic content, also gave Yuan Chengjie The opportunity to bathe and bed play, show off his bodybuilding shape and shape, no one can rival. Don&#39;t talk nonsense, let&#39;s talk about the story of &quot;Step by Step&quot;. A private hospital, a hospital-owned pharmaceutical factory, a mysterious behind-the-scenes person, surrounded by a bottle of strange potions, unfolding killings, twists and turns, the plot is bizarre. As a true 3D horror film, bloody and dark scenes in the film are everywhere, blood is splashing, poisonous fog is overflowing, and the sun is shining. Part of the bridge that surpassed the development of the realistic plot was presented in the form of computer painting, which became the biggest surprise for the scene to scream.",movie
971,"Itâ€™s not enough to have fewer movies in the cinema hall last week, so there are no particularly attractive movies. Can only be selected in the Elf Hostel, Raytheon and Jinyu Shelling. I don&#39;t have a cold for this golden hustle. I don&#39;t know why I have to spend money to watch two old-fashioned two-year-old fights? I have always had no feelings about action movies. At that time, the golden screen of the shell was placed on the big screen. Wow, it looked like a very nice look, so I turned it again. It turns out that this money is really not white. As far as commercial films are concerned, the products from the assembly line are responsible and responsible. Practical, the movie looks good. From the very beginning, the film has caught people. After Stallone escaped from prison, she waited for the appetite of the audience to be arrested. Then she unveiled a person who specializes in prison holes and proposed a modification plan to escape from prison. This identity arrangement is very clever. After the CIA beauty came in and entered the unknown grave, a cramped and completely transparent prison room appeared quite shocking. The next time this feeling is of course to climb out of the channel and find it in the sea. Although the various designs are inevitably unrealistic, the commercial films have never been too rigorous, otherwise they will not be able to shoot, and in the end they will be very enjoyable. At first, Schwarzeneggerâ€™s active approach did not seem to have enough reasonable explanations, and it ended up rounding all this right. In addition to the escape technology level arrangement, it is not necessary to force the prisoner to kill the family. The motivation is that the insurance company boss is not able to flip. This can be regarded as a plot of the plot.",movie
972,"The British royal family is a historical relic. It has always been thought that the Qing Dynasty was too successful and too powerful, so it was too sturdy and self-styled to be arrogant, so it was destroyed. If the Reform Movement of 1898 is successful, China will follow the capitalist road like the Meiji Restoration of Japan. Perhaps the Qing Dynasty can retain the royal status as the United Kingdom, Japan, and Spain, and there is no danger of extinction. It seems that this is far from the case. The royal family was originally a historical relic. Recently, reading the book introducing the history and politics of various countries, the United Kingdom is the first chapter. Looking at this movie, I understand that on the one hand, people have admiration for the royal family. On the other hand, people also believe that the constitutional reform of the monarchy has been eliminated. Today, when democracy has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the royal family should have been abolished. In complex circumstances, for the family disputes of the royal family, people hold some watching the lively mentality. Diana is undoubtedly one of the most influential members of the royal family, even after she has bid farewell to the royal family. People have a lot of understanding of Diana, there is a lot of love, and there are many opinions that are taken for granted. People are willing to treat her with a more kind heart, but it is difficult to analyze the Queen&#39;s thoughts and decisions with the same heart. Of course, the film still has a preference for the queen. Although she is impressed by the atmosphere, she has her own determined will. She believes that the monarchical authority teaches her to believe that her identity is inalienable to God and the people, and she is unwilling to use it in the face of unfortunate events. Excessive expression to express, but also can not accept the public to show their weakness in the face of the public. Finally, a quarter of the people opposed the abolition of the monarch to let her change, and she compromised for the honor and status of herself and the royal family. The director did not dare to disrespect the Queen, and did not dare to disagree with Dai Aina, so the scale of the film was put in place. But for Blair, I really don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t know if I have personal preference. Helen Mirren used this film to win the Oscar. It is said that the Queen himself said that he was &quot;very interesting&quot; in the play.",movie
973,"The beginning is war. I don&#39;t like this kind of thing, but it can be done later. Although the idea is a bit confusing, there are many people, who has a relationship with everyone, and finally it is all right, it is nothing more than being smashed by Si Gege. Inside, Gauss and Sieg looked so old that they were older than the movies they made later, and Sieg had already entered the old age. Although the action is still hot, but the use of pistols has increased significantly, and more moves are almost a few off the opponent. Opposite a 1 meter 9 big man, is a master of all kinds of Taoist mix, you just wait to die. The main line is definitely that the partner and the Siegel are both mercenaries, and the partner died accidentally. He has to take responsibility for taking care of his wife and children. At this time, a savvy person found Sieg, to save the son of the Greek tycoon, and Sigg teased them. Another fake man forced him to kidnap his wife and children, and the result was counted again. The result is of course the uncle Shu Ge, rescued his wife and children, and killed his opponent.",movie
974,"Two hours after the final completion, I calmly recalled every touch to the inner details. BGM is the Cloud Atlas End Title. I want to take a serious look at this drama, and I will silently say goodbye in my heart. Saul who can&#39;t get a better call. Fortunately, you are ups and downs in this life. The same is true of the outsiders we seem to be related to. No matter how many unacceptable values â€‹â€‹in the heart, what is left is the deep sigh and endless sigh. Isn&#39;t the mouth so hard to die? Yes, this is where the earth sign is going. I am convinced that Laobai is Virgo, and the small powder is Taurus. This is willing to fight for a lifetime, but the two constellations, which are often poisonous and deadly, come together. I really donâ€™t know if itâ€™s happiness or worry. So many beautiful plots, the sparks that come up between any two people&#39;s combinations, will eventually be beaten by a slap in the face. The death of life is always too late to prevent you. You know that you will end up in tragic death, guess the result, but never guess the process. Those who are bound by a ring of love, those who can&#39;t be separated from the concealment and resentment, you can hardly say that there is hate in love, although not hate, not far from it. Language is the most lethal thing except bombs, guns and poisons, except for the simple melting of the moment when the four eyes meet. In fact, no one really knows who, but only experienced too much, too much warmth, too many escapes. When God pushes you together with a big hand, and then separates, there is no way, all the luck and helplessness are destined. I want to say the old-fashioned lines, but I am still alive. The truth is that almost all are dead, and living is like death. Life will be a thousand miles away, it will not be better. If you already know the ending, do you choose to go back, or sit and watch the sunset, do not participate? Still, still reciprocating, but prepare a VCR, leave it to your loved ones, tell them, your true, deep love.",movie

Look at the three women who are playing by Perel, and they can bring the salt of the law! The first female director, the button opened to the chest, the purple shirt, the pinch, the cigarette, the very casual literary female middle-aged school; the second wide wife, the high-heeled shoes, to the seaside kiss with a slap in the face, Good soap opera, she made a girl prayer like wood (see poster); the third abandoned woman, very close, not too resentful, finally found the lighthouse, in a Korean man&#39;s tent! I would like to say such a plot, for Pell, is it a bit? . After all, she is not young, but there is no problem at all! She is probably 50 years old and has the same style. Life is coming, do you have it? The woman in the film complains that men only know sex, why can&#39;t women know more about sex? Right, the woman has to be nurtured to raise (you see, the woman who Wensu Li plays is heavy), she needs to bear more &quot;responsibility&quot; (the original words in the film, actually explored life!), no The mind goes to &quot;sex&quot;. Is there no mind, or is it domesticated? I am a wife who is a mother and is loyal to the family. The last woman, when she was abandoned by her husband, the two sons have grown up and have their own lives, then she should find her own life. If it weren&#39;t for family changes, she might not have thought of coming to distant South Korea and running into the seaside with a shochu bottle. Indulgence is not about directivity, but there is no liberation without restraint. Itâ€™s inevitable that you will go to bed. It seems that pretending to be very sad, abandoned by her husband, went to a remote seaside in Asia, full of sorrow, but also worshipped Buddha and asked the master, and finally found the answer on a muscle guy. People are so funny. Women and men are the same. This is the French woman of Hong Shangxiu YY, the real French woman, who realizes that life will not be so expensive, and it will be liberated now. Hong Shangxiu has been drinking shochu for the sake of forgetting that he is a man, but after all, he canâ€™t forget it, he can only make movies, and men (please use Wuhan dialect). So, the man thought about it and thought about how to combine that thing with the light and the big. The matter itself is not dark and ugly, but he has to think so, and he has to be ugly.

The male and female protagonists share the same hobby. There are also troubles in your own life to solve, just like love and bread, you have to solve the bread before you have thoughts about love. This is a film full of music. The photographer uses a hand-held film to feel more immersive. There is a feeling of live, the film is very slow, and the simple and sincere of the hero and the hero has always attracted me to look down. Thinking about the plot is due to music, the male and female protagonists get to know each other and live together, but the ending is not what I think, the whole film has no kiss and no hug, still affecting my attention. I am lazy, I sneaked on other people&#39;s comments before I started to write a film review. The favorite song is the song that the actor sang and the former girlfriend&#39;s film. The affection is not only the lyrics and the melody. The expression when playing is more important in boxing.

977,"In the past decade or so, the proliferation of students in secondary schools and the proliferation of problem students have gradually become a problem for educators. The film and literature works with the theme of this have also become popular. It is hard to say which party promoted which party. If the film and television works such as &quot;GTO Spicy Teacher&quot; at least treat the problem students as objects that can be educated and reformed, and provide a comedy-style solution, then &quot;The Gate of Elimination&quot; is based on its dark tone and chilling. The brushwork portrays a scene of ruthlessness and near despair. Because the same students in the school as the main body of the novel, and have similar &quot;confined space + collective execution&quot; overhead, many people may immediately link the book &quot;Big Run&quot; led by Kitano Takeshi. However, while carefully preparing the aerial scene, the book &quot;Su&quot; also spent a lot of ink on various details that can be immediately connected to the atmosphere, such as the bumpy experience of Ayako, the psychological activities of the abducted students, and the siege of the police. The internal coordination of the bureaucracy, the relationship between the parents of the students and the children, etc., the sense of reality and the sense of coldness must be more intense. Such detailed and comprehensive descriptions also imply that the author&#39;s ambitions are not limited to the issue of juvenile education and crime punishment. It must be admitted that the misdeeds of Class D students in &quot;Su&quot; are much more serious than the students in the ordinary sense; truancy, bullying, stealing, gambling and even joining the underworld are insignificant, flying, beating specific people, extortion Money, drug trafficking, robbery, and rape of women are also commonplace. Most of the more than 20 people have done their lives. The most ridiculous thing is that there are people who put stones on the rails several times because of fun, which eventually led to the derailment of the train. Heavy casualties. It seems that it is impossible for a teenager who has intentionally or unintentionally committed a crime to commit a crime and does not consider the consequences at all, expecting them to change themselves through transformation and repentance. Hei Wuyang also borrowed the mouth of Ayako, accusing the society of &quot;taking a protectionist attitude&quot; on the pretext that such people are still young, and her purpose is to let the teenagers realize the truth through the most brutal punishment. What was wrong, and therefore took responsibility. On the surface, this is a very tempting logic. In the words of the popular Japanese drama &quot;Yokozawa Naoki&quot;, it is &quot;to pay back the teeth and repay it.&quot; But does this logic really work? Just because a group of students who do not do evil, will cause such a bloody incident? In fact, all the details described by Hei Wuyang are clearly pointed out.A certain aspect of Japanese society. Yasushi, who was transformed into a victim by the victim, was born into a family of strict family education, but his father was accused by public opinion because of the students in his school. He eventually hanged himself; she was seduce by a woman husband and gave birth. Aki, who was abandoned by her lover and accused by her family; she witnessed a male colleague who raped a female student, and the female student could only swallow her voice under the coercion. It can be said that her despair of society and humanity has long been cultivated by personal experience and social infusion, not just because of bad students. And every move she made in the kidnapping case forced the Japanese society to fully function, and thus showed many dark side of her own: she deliberately let parents know the list of executed students, many parents seem to have heard that their children have lost their lives, it seems Freed from the trouble and sighed, and refused to make ransom for other survivors. His face was naked and the people were indifferent. It was doubtful whether they had fulfilled the true parental responsibility and whether they had truly educated their children. In this sense, those who are wicked are actually victims of the lack of education and care. She sometimes conceals her purpose, and sometimes reveals information without reservation. She sometimes asks the police to meet the conditions for approval through the layers of the system in a short period of time, and then fully utilizes the ability of the media to capture the wind and shadow, thoroughly revealing the chaos of the internal command system of the police. The bureaucracy is inefficient, the media does not hesitate to create a sensational effect, and the faces of various experts and scholars are open to the public. More ironically, after the kidnapping case, among the parents of a flustered student, the most authoritative and able to keep calm and pressure the police, it is actually a couple of triad leaders, showing the influence of semi-publicized underworld organizations in Japan. Strong. The only event that reflected the strengths of the Japanese system was that the police coordinated several television stations before the attack to record the footage in minutes to the minute and then repeatedly played it, smashing the Ayako who monitored the police by live television. The Japanese and Japanese society that can achieve such a fine plan and seamless execution are full of unbearable problems. They have repeatedly tolerated the fall of the education system, letting themselves and even taking the initiative to create youth violence and crime. People ponder. The ending of &quot;Su&quot; is tragic: the victim retaliated against the perpetrators for &quot;returning their teeth&quot; and destroying each other while destroying each other. The tragic ending begins with the tragic humanity? Everyone is a perpetrator, but it can also be a victim, and these two sidesThe conversion turned out to be only a moment. This contradictory humanity is fermented, magnified, and eventually erupted in a society where the atmosphere is suppressed, the care of the people is lacking, the utilitarianism is rampant, the moral education is cold, the rights of certain groups are emphasized, and other groups are more obedient. However, these problems that Black Wuyang points out may not exist in Japan alone. Otherwise, campus violence may not be so sudden in the education system of East Asian countries that traditionally emphasize discipline, obedience and academic focus. Reminiscent of the recent frequent rape, murder, bullying video, etc. in the country, it seems that public opinion always points to the lack of school discipline, the lack of morality of parents, and the voice of â€œrecognitionâ€ and â€œlearningâ€ on the Internet. The events described in Su are strikingly similar, but there is little deep reflection on the root cause of the problem. This is not to say that we should &quot;sympathize with&quot; evil students because of personal background and social factors, but ask us to face a serious problem raised by Hei Wuyang through &quot;The Gate of Elimination&quot;: when a social structure and culture systematically Manufactured the injurer? The two sides of the victim, and gradually blocked their way of improvement and correction, so that they eventually reached the extreme of human nature, what is justice, what is responsibility, and who can claim to maintain Justice, do your duty? Ayako personally opened the door of the purge, cleared more than twenty &quot;dead and lingering&quot; middle school students and a face-to-heart teacher; but triggering her to open the door of the clear, I am afraid not just a group of &quot;wicked people&quot; is as simple.",movie
978,"This is a biography of Secretary Clinton&#39;s career and diplomatic activities, as well as a personal observation of the history of American diplomacy. Although it records the events of Obama&#39;s first term from 2009 to 2011, almost all of the important topics covered in the book have been raging over the past year: the Middle East and North Africa chaos continues, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya The democratic process has been difficult, and the Syrian issue has been dragged on for a long time. The USâ€™s strategy of â€œreturning to the Asia-Pacificâ€ is moving forward. The US-China relationship is quiet and windy. The US-Japan relationship has gradually broken through various small frictions. Afterwards, the â€œprismâ€ scandal has intensified, revealing many of the dark side of American diplomacy and politics... which undoubtedly enhances the topicality and readability of this book. What is more noteworthy is that this also reflects the fact that since the Obama took office, the United States has a strong continuity in its diplomatic focus and region, although another problem brought about by this continuity is that it is difficult for the United States to get out of the relevant problems. In the United States, there is always a complex complex that is hard to say. We can count the shortcomings that do exist in American society, but it is difficult to ignore the great vitality and creativity that this society has at the same time; we can criticize her hegemonic policy, but can&#39;t deny her influence in the world today; can cheer The decline of US national power since the financial crisis, but has to face up to the impact of the US recession on the country. The author has an unparalleled convenience in observing and experiencing American diplomacy: as a member of the US State Department, she can closely observe Hillaryâ€™s words and deeds and the details of US foreign policy; she has experienced foreign policy from the United States. The role of the receiver to the &quot;issuing end&quot; has a deeper personal experience than the outsiders in all aspects of American diplomacy. The text of this book has a strong personal color. It is a clip-on discussion and a lot of words that recall the author&#39;s life. Sometimes the reader will need to work hard to identify and sort out; but whether we agree with the author&#39;s analysis or not, she is interested in Sheila. The detailed records of the words and deeds, and the detailed records of US diplomacy behind the scenes of the crisis are undoubtedly a valuable close-up observation of American politics and diplomacy. The scene of the actual operation of American diplomacy in the book may be different from the imagination of some people. Although the US diplomatic system has more than 10,000 elite staff, it has not achieved any major breakthroughs in terms of efficiency and communication in all the bureaucratic institutions; on the contrary, too many elites,Excessive views collide, lengthy procedures and decision-making procedures, as well as pressure to face almost all the problems of the world, but make this system lack of bans. Hillary stressed the line of public diplomacy and civilian diplomacy, and demanded that diplomats change their previous style of higher education. More attention than ever (public and foreign) public opinion and public opinion feedback on the effectiveness of foreign policy has added to the burden of US diplomats. In the book, whenever there is a major crisis, the American diplomats who write under the author will always behave in a bit of a disappointment, and it will take some time to slow down. More than once, officials of the State Council have become overworked or have trouble caused by misconduct. For those who have a complex chain of reasoning that can be attributed to the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; of the ubiquitous black hand in the United States, this may provide another perspective. As for Hillary himself, it may be the most active and topical first lady in the United States since Jacqueline Kennedy. She is a woman with strong personality, and gradually got rid of her image as a subsidiary of her husband, and grew into a unique politician. The experience of serving as Secretary of State during Obamaâ€™s first term made her a general American politician and potential presidential candidate. Have practical diplomatic work experience. But this multiple identities also gave Hillary a variety of troubles to balance: feminine charm and soft body are the hallmarks of Hillary, and capital that can be used in diplomatic situations, but in public opinion society may be public opinion and big mouth Critics put on too weak labels; politician status makes her face the pressure of US domestic voters and Democratic election machines, and their attention to diplomacy is much lower than that of the US internal affairs, and she has to deal with the old days. In the diplomatic squad, Hillary tried to reshape the image of American democracy and diplomacy in front of the global audience, but because of various cultural, political and historical barriers and the reality of the economic recession, the results were doubtful. Hillaryâ€™s predicament also reflects a dilemma in the political and diplomatic aspects of the entire United States: the United States is indeed a hegemonic power with global influence, but she is first a nation-state with a national interest, and secondly Democracies that have been greatly influenced by public opinion in decision-making have finally grown into hegemonic countries because of historical opportunities, national strength, and certain advantages. How to balance these three aspects, take care of national interests while maintaining hegemony, and not let foreign policy completely detach from democracy.Beyond, it is a difficult problem in the United States. Of course, with Hillaryâ€™s wisdom and the city, there are several â€œreal temperaments and ideasâ€ that the author shows. It is worth pondering and savouring, just as the United States is always good at wrapping its image and diplomatic motives with sublime and exciting words. same. In the same way, Hillaryâ€™s talents and skills ensure at least a certain achievement during her tenure as Secretary of State and a relatively good reputation. With the strength and innovative ability of the United States, it is now said that the United States has built the world together with her. Order has faded irretrievably, and it is still too early to say. We may have been too accustomed to the hegemony of the United States. It is customary to use imagination to imagine what a &quot;post-United States&quot; world would look like if the existing world order gradually declined. In the book, the author gives the analysis and opinions that support the United States to continue to maintain the status quo. We don&#39;t have to agree with her, but we can use the book she provided to conduct our own analysis and imagination. If China really wants to become a world power, it will face a series of crises and problems described in the book sooner or later.

979,"Watching the poster, watching the introduction, &quot;Step by Step&quot; is a horror film, I am very curious why the film is not placed in the Halloween period just past, its good quality 3D effect should have hope in one Heap in the homogenous works. After watching the film, my doubts disappeared. &quot;Step by Step&quot; has a horrible element, but when you step out of the theater, you won&#39;t tell others that I just watched a horror film. In fact, I can&#39;t classify it as a specific type or a certain type. It must be classified and can only borrow a proper noun from the Western critics, Camp. The characteristics of the Camp movie are also difficult to say in a few words, you can understand it as a variety of styles, tone, composition of the mess. To what extent? Let&#39;s just say that Quentin and Rodriguez&#39;s movies are too boring. There are many Camp films in Chinese films. For example, in the 1980s, there was a â€œShaw Group Collective Creation Groupâ€, which was good at making â€œEternal Dragonsâ€ into â€œStar Trekâ€ and â€œFang Shen Bangâ€ as â€œSupermanâ€. But people are a group of people who talked about the scripts that they talked about, and there are only two writers in the film. I admire them. They must have seen countless movies. Because I can&#39;t spoil, I decided to distract the entertainment elements in the film and explain them briefly so that everyone can see the characteristics of this Chinese Camp film. The first is to detect the reasoning. The handsome doctor stunned Conan to come up with an indoor reasoning show. He also repeatedly sneaked into the enemy camp to investigate, but he was arrested several times or made a joke. He played detectives and acted as a commercial spy. He played a high-tech trick on the luxury yacht, playing the &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;, and also made several placement advertisements. Action thrills can&#39;t be less, such as cars turning over the sky, falling cliffs, close-knit, and running away, and so on. The gangster temperament is also there. The entertainment city can be really wild and fierce, and the bar has a &quot;fighting wolf&quot; style. Romantic love is indispensable, the girl&#39;s inner confession, can give a slow female audience a female psychological class, as well as sensational life and death confession, in an attempt to let the audience cry, smashed out, it is really the material of the Singles Day . Since the horror is marked, the drama of the haunted house and the nightmare of the nightmare can not be less, and the big task of showing off the 3D effect is given to them. There is no sensational comedy, that part of the action should be imitated by the &quot;12 Zodiac&quot;, but the sneak peek of Zhou Xingchi, with good and bad self-confident. In addition, the visual effect of the dismembered piece is added, the broken hand is broken, the blood stab is drawn, and the bathroom is slaughtered.What, my dizzy friends remember to blink. In addition to summing up the large-scale theme of this water, the film is also covered with a erotic painting. However, all the main female characters, all dressed up hot and hot, even &quot;good women&quot; should also be a sexy in the name of justice. Dew the business line, beautiful legs, wash the bubble bath, masturbation in the water, how to tease how come. The bottom line of the review is that you can&#39;t show your chest. If you do it, you can show a fake cockroach, or you can keep your hands open. In every scene where a beautiful woman appears, you can expect to see a crisp chest, bare back or calf, no exception. From time to time, the director arranges a few bed games, only listening to the theater or rescuing the woman&#39;s ecstasy, but the lens is always in the right place, with ulterior motives removed. There is a paragraph that is impressive and worthy of a separate mention. It is said that the hospital advocates etiquette reform, so a group of new deans in the hall directs the doctors to study the five-view four-eyed look-up lens, playing the magnificent symphony in the background. My first reaction at that time was to cleanse the brain and to think of the &quot;Opera killer&quot;. Later, the film really echoed, but the explanation was brought to &quot;Hitler&quot;. It is a pity that such a serious and expressive piece is placed in the Camp film and is a joke.",movie
980,"Seeing this movie naturally reminds me of another Korean classic thriller reasoning film &quot;Murdering Memories&quot;. Although the subject matter is not the same, it has the same black tone and the same rhythm. Perhaps it is &quot;killing memories&quot; too classic. It is natural and unnatural to think of it when watching Korean movies of similar subjects. Although this film has not yet reached the height of &quot;Murdering Memories&quot;, it is considered a superior in movies of the same type. The successful director of this film can be said to be indispensable. Such a theme will show different effects in the hands of different directors. The film director has seized the essence of vigilance and fighting, and you come to me between the electric and the flint. It is also the difference between a true and a false one. Although the protagonist is not a former criminal police but has been a pimp, it also injects a ambiguous element into the film, which makes the filmâ€™s overall feeling different from the simple simple battle of the past and the evil. The three forces broke the binary opposition pattern of the general vigilance theme. The director also accurately grasped the changes of these three forces when dealing with the plot. The main line of the plot closely surrounds the killing event, and the branch plot is in the protagonist. The interaction with the little girl enriches the characters. Seeing the bloody scenes of hammers and headshots in many places, I also think of the exciting &quot;Old Boy&quot;. The more I see Jin Yunshi, the more I want Cui Yuzhi, the South Korean uncle is really not talking about it, compared to the Korean cream. The niches are really not enough to watch. The South Korean uncle has some sloppy scum and a slightly fat body. It is like a middle-aged person who is a little bit unremarkable in the weekdays. This kind of image is usually said to be a middle-aged crisis. Lifting him up, maybe itâ€™s been so swaying all over the life, nothing is said to be full of grievances, but how can it be so loved and carefully placed in the film? ! The uncle is already awkward, and the film has to be accompanied by a small loli. It is obvious that the imitation of &quot;this killer is not too cold&quot;, but I have to say that even if the Koreans imitate and imitate the reasonableness, it is very natural in the plot. If it is placed in the hands of Chinese directors, in addition to changing Paris to Beijing, it is estimated that it will be able to do the tricks on the bonsai varieties that the little girl holds. South Koreaâ€™s uncle doesnâ€™t like to use a gun. Itâ€™s really domineering with a hammer headshot. Itâ€™s very textured when you knock on the skull. The murderous and sullen voice makes the audience more shocked. Itâ€™s far more shocking than the machine gun. The question of why Koreans love hammers so much is worthy of further discussion. The only point of the filmThe trick is that the expression of the motive of the crime is not sufficient. The expression interspersed in the plot is rather messy. In fact, the director is also a suspense of motivation. The fact of killing has already been given to the audience. The only question is why is this abnormal? The director gave psychological motivation caused by physical defects. Perhaps such a thing is too common to affect such killing, but the director gave his own answer is better than no answer. This mix of movies is just right. It combines many classic elements.",movie
981,"To be honest, &quot;Raytheon 2: Dark World&quot; is not only stronger than &quot;Raytheon 1&quot; but also stronger than the recent &quot;Wolverine 2&quot;. This year&#39;s sequel to the sequel is very lacking in the plot, nothing more than Selling some star elements and hot scenes, the only &quot;Star Trek&quot; that makes people shine is the big villain of the blessings, so watching &quot;Raytheon 2: Dark World&quot; is not necessary to entangle the dog blood on the plot, at least in the picture. On &quot;Raytheon 2&quot; gives his sincerity. Perhaps the &quot;Avengers&quot; saved the hammer brother, Raytheon is a bit innately inferior to other superheroes. The hammer is a metamorphosis and even a cool taste in the &quot;Old Boy&quot; and &quot;The Pursuit&quot;. But put it on the superhero is a bit of a cottage, even if the power of Thor&#39;s hammer is not comparable to the nail hammer, but it is still not as good as Iron Man&#39;s suit, Batman&#39;s chariot, Spider-Man&#39;s ability to pull the wind Deaf people, even if everyone else is a human being, Raytheon is shocked to be a heavenly person, but the audience will not care about this difference, and then say how fluent American English and beautiful chicks are entangled, what is the difference between God and God? Perhaps the biggest breakthrough in Raytheon 2: The Dark World is that there are a lot of humorous elements in the film. From the beginning of the movie to the end of the story, the greatest effect of the Earth is funny, although Natalie Portman has a plot. The key role, but after all, when the real knife is really a gun, there is still no small woman to fight, and the heavy drama is still on the hammer brother. The high-popular Loki in this episode is a little cold, although the end is opposite. Turning to the next episode left a suspense worthy of a big book, but this episode hopes to see the audience of Loki may be disappointed, but in any case how to become the captain of the Captain America is undoubtedly a highlight of the film, memorable. In the age of this superhero&#39;s aesthetic fatigue, it is difficult to expect such a blockbuster to give the audience a shocking sense of the senses. The two-hour film can be satisfied with the happiness.",movie
982,"Finally, after the so-called Singles Day solar calendar birthday, how to rely on the skin, has passed 25 years of age, and then a few years is the year of standing. Still squatting here, the unsuccessful and unrestrained perfunctory parents asked about her boyfriend. Perhaps it is because I didnâ€™t lack the reason why boys liked it when I was young (now I think about it), even if I am still so old, I still like the boys, I am connected with SMS every day, so itâ€™s so calm, it seems like this. The age of oneself will not rise as well. It has always rejected the arrangement of blind date. Blind date is just the environment for working now. Apart from this small circle, there is no chance to contact new boys. It is not based on outsiders, only in acquaintances. For this statement, it can only be a reaction. If you make a positive result, you will be happy. I tried to communicate and found that it was not suitable. Even ordinary friends could not do it. The relatives who have never been impressed have said that they are introduced to the boys who are two years old. They emphasize that the boy is very honest. He is afraid that he is too honest. His father is working in the local tax bureau. His family conditions are also good. He has already prepared a 160-square wedding room. . Of course, this is a post-order. I donâ€™t know why. When I feel that my classmates are not reliable, I have heard the problem of this house. I actually feel that I can go and see, honest boys, I can control myself. Well, always the mobile phone number is known by others and is in a passive state. The photos that I have never received on WeChat are that the fate of even meeting is not there? ! Ok, when Iâ€™ve been a little bit interested in getting to know strangers, Iâ€™ve received a message saying thereâ€™s no chance. The other mother&#39;s mom may have secretly sneaked into the unit to look at me, and then a girl who is working at the police station is also dating him at the same time. Well, the other party is fancy, so there is no more. Relatives comforted and said that the other party did not have me outstanding, beautiful, and was caught by the other party in a busy and anxious state, obviously suffering. At the noisy busy noon, it was a bit sad to watch this message on the only bright cell phone on a dark lounge chair. I remembered the first time: I never knew other options, but I knew that I was the first option to be eliminated.",movie
983,"The &quot;Control&quot; ambition is particularly large. Director Bi Guozhi tried to shoot &quot;National Enemy&quot; in the form of &quot;Drums&quot;, which emptied the background of the times and added elements such as gun battles, chasing, revenge, and high-tech scenes to the film. Yao Chen and Wu Yanzu, two famous actors who have just been born as fathers and mothers, plus Ren Dahua, Dai Liren, An Yixuan and Shao Bing, have formed a star-studded lineup, obviously for the recent box office of &quot;Greating Gravity&quot; and &quot;Hunger Games 2&quot;. The film&#39;s surface revolves around the theme of &quot;controlled&quot; and &quot;out of control&quot;, but it tells a story about conspiracy and redemption. The insurance salesman Mark Yinyin was caught by the mysterious man and kept &quot;controlling&quot; him to commit crimes. He encountered the first love girlfriend Jiexi in the road, and San Mao, private detective who was also &quot;controlled&quot;, and finally battled with the mysterious BOSS. . The first half of &quot;Control&quot; has been deeply immersed in the unsolved mystery. Who is the &quot;mysterious person&quot;? How do male and female protagonists escape? Under the control of the &quot;mysterious person&quot;, these people who are &quot;chess pieces&quot; always commit crimes and black market transactions. When people are forced to the edge of despair, they are naturally crazy and desperate! The performance of Wu Yanzu is the biggest highlight of &quot;Control&quot;. The buddy is very good at panic, timidity and panic, and to save the three hairs, suddenly posing as an enemy, the evil face, showing the style of strength. In fact, &quot;Disciple&quot; &quot;Eavesdropping 2&quot; did not nominate the Emperor, which is unfair to Wu Yanzu, I believe that he will one day win the Golden Elephant. Yao Chen&#39;s red-looking style is eye-catching, and the sizzling head is &quot;hidden&quot;. Dai Liren is a crude black society villain. Ren Dahua finally turned his head and swayed the gangster back, and returned to the &quot;Liangjiang Fengyun&quot; feeling. An Yixuan, Hui Yinghong, Shao Bing guest, also let the film stars gathered. The background of &quot;Control&quot; is the fictional future of &quot;Sinful Floating City&quot;. Through the Hollywood special effects to create a steel forest and a city like a beast in the forest, the transparent IPHONE mobile phone used by everyone is full of modernity. But watching is a sci-fi big scene, there is still a gangster suspense film in the bones. At the end of the film became the prince Avengers, and also joined a lot of people to engage in conspiracy to make all sci-fi scenes into furnishings. In the film, under a burst of gunfire, a group of gangsters were shot and killed. Mark&#39;s mother lived in a paradise-like nursing home under the protection of a group of children, and also walked the old road of &quot;evil is invincible&quot;. Control and counter-control, manipulation and manipulation, justice and evil, the dramatic reversal of the characters in the climax, and the truth revealed at the last moment of the film, I was completely shocked. But Bi GuoThe director, scriptwriter, and editing ability of the wise man is too strong, so the script is full of various reversals, which leads to my limited IQ and has not returned to God for a long time. Of course, there are still many violent elements in the film, such as forcing the husband to eat his wife&#39;s fingers. For example, Ren Dahua is holding a can to face Wu Yanzu&#39;s face and sulking, and Wu Yanzu is half exposed to bathe, causing all female audiences to scream crazy. Especially the simulation of the sound station word &quot;We see hell&quot;! &quot;My kidney is given by San Mao&quot;, &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you too&quot;. These lines will be fire! This is a very interesting and innovative commercial film, and left an open end, as if to declare to the global evil city: &quot;We see hell.&quot; &quot;War Drum&quot; and &quot;Control&quot; let me see the absolute skill of Bi Guozhi&#39;s director. This shock can&#39;t be described in words!",movie

985,"Lao Luo, whose real name is Luo Yonghao, was born in July 1972. The network red man, known as the Lao Luo quotation in the network of rivers and lakes, I think that some of our unmarried young men also listened very much, like his swearing, still like it, even though he is not a speaker. Why is this? I think perhaps his words are real, or perhaps his life experience gives hope to some people in the society, so that they can live without drifting, perhaps his scorn. It is the first time to read his book. In fact, I have already seen the content inside. It is nothing more than a text version. There are four parts in this book. The first part is the speech of &quot;My Struggle&quot; of Red Network, and the second part is about his own story of growth. The third part is some interviews and dialogues. The fourth part is the old Luo quotation. In fact, I don&#39;t think there is any meaning in the next two chapters. The first two chapters are OK. The overall price of this 29 yuan book is worthy. This book is called &quot;My Struggle&quot;. I think it is a real inspirational book. It really doesn&#39;t preach that all the grass should be a big tree. All the one-six-seven shorts should go to the NBA. All people &quot;can succeed if they work hard&quot;. It only tells the story of Luo Yonghao&#39;s growth and struggle, and more realistically smoothes the inner heart of our heart. I looked backwards. I looked at the next two chapters and laughed. Then look at the growth experience of Lao Luo. The book knows that Lao Luoâ€™s father was still a small cadre. He was a county party secretary, but Lao Luo has never lived the kind of strong life of the so-called large courtyard children. Although I have not received much grievances, I canâ€™t talk much about it. The book records his very happy memories. In his midsummer season, one person is free to read the life of books in a huge and shady library, and also in the blue sky and sunny days, smelling the air. The freshness of the sun lying on the rocky beach. The experience he had when he was in school was quite interesting. He also criticized the education system at that time. I hope that our education will have more appreciation and encouragement for children. Donâ€™t force the children to do what they think is humiliating. Of course, it is recorded. Let Lao Luo feel the warmth and satisfaction of life, let him be the educator of the life-saving and worthwhile trip. As a teacher, I also want to reflect on whether there are the characteristics of the bastard teachers written by Lao Luo. The book also records his emotional experience, I think it seems that I was the same, è…¼è…†, childish but sincere. The growth experience described in the second chapter seems to be the first chapter of Lao Luoâ€™s speech.The prequel, but the most exciting part of this book is the first chapter, his speech part. Lao Luo first talked about successful people. He said: &quot;In China, it is very strange that we define so-called successful people, which refers to some landlords. Our society is defined as such, but I am not so defined. I think that you are a landlord. Or the wealthy lord, the poor and the poor are still poor, as long as they are happy, and they persist in themselves, they are successful people.&quot; He then began to talk about his 37 years of experience. He accepted more than nine years of education that was deprived of his ability to think. After dropping out of school. Lao Luo has been reading a book for three years at home. There is no direction, goal, plan, or reading. But he thinks that these three years may be his most intensive three years of knowledge, and the harvest is particularly large. In fact, I am very envious of Lao Luo this time, I also hope that even if there is a month like that. Lao Luo started his business at the age of 28, studied English for a year, and spent the most difficult 30 days of his life in New Oriental. This description of Lao Luo is very good, but he is really real. I feel that he is not easy to learn. In the spring of 2001, Lao Luo was hired to succeed in New Oriental. He began to teach in March and left his teaching position in June 2006. He taught for 5 years and 3 months. In the field of GRE training, he has always been recognized in China. Brother, and Lao Luo did not take the sidelines of his predecessors. After leaving New Oriental, Lao Luo founded the website, and there are also many heroic deeds. I think that our society needs someone to do this righteous thing. Finally, I will talk about the establishment of an English school. In fact, these are old things, this is all before 2010, I have heard his latest video recently, still funny. I donâ€™t know what I wrote before, and I feel like a mess. In fact, what makes me most tempted is that Luo said in the speech that he finally changed the world. Lao Luo said that in todayâ€™s society, many people are capable. Talented, passionate, but nothing, because he will not be sleek, will not play in front of colleagues, nothing. The result is that you have a strong ability to work and are very upright. At the age of 30, nothing can be achieved. These people are painfully discovering the sinister sluts around them. The little rabbits who lived especially beautifully at the age of seventeen or eight, are as good as the fish in the society, so they follow the hooligans, thinking that this is the so-called maturity. In fact, this is not mature and called shameless. If you are straightforward in your life, you are not doing anything, you donâ€™t do anything evil.The things of the heart, did not do anything that caused harm to others, and spent the rest of my life fighting for the old wife, children, and aging mothers, taking care of these people around them, not making a name, not making a fortune, not making great careers, and being honest all their lives. Finally, I stalked my neck and died at the age of 70 or 80. Have you not changed the world in your life? You still change the world, you have made the world a little better. Because of you, there is another good man in this world. These words made me listen to the tide, I think this is my true portrayal, although I am not capable, but I am difficult to mature, because I have to face. But I am still a good person, I hope to make this world a little better. Finally, in the end of the book, in this world, the bad guys seem to be always more diligent, so I am more diligent than the bad guys, to live forever young, and always tears.",movie

987,"The film tells the story of a team of soldiers trained by death penalty prisoners who have not died before they die. In 1968, North Korea sent a team of soldiers to assassinate the South Korean president. In order to retaliate against North Korea, South Korea also began training the same assassination team. This team consists entirely of condemned prisoners. Under the leadership of several officers, they began tough training in Shiwei Island. The whole team was divided into three teams, each of whom was captained by three people with different personalities. At first, the three people could not understand each other, but in the slow contact and life, the three people resolved the contradictions and formed deep feelings. When the troops were ready to start training, they were told that the mission was cancelled. In this way, the whole team began to live on the island, but as time went by, the soldiers became more and more unhappy. At the same time, the superior decided to remove the entire team according to the international situation, although the training commander did not agree. Therefore, the officer deliberately revealed the news to one of the three captains, so that the soldiers decided to preemptively kill the people who guarded them throughout the island. As a result, a scuffle broke out on the island and the soldiers won. Next, after the soldiers boarded the mainland to rob a bus, they drove to the presidential palace. The soldiers on the road were attacked by various troops. They resisted hard, but the death and injury were heavy. In the end, the surviving soldiers detonated all the grenade suicides, all of which were seen by the surviving officers who had trained them. I heard about this movie eight or nine years ago, and the evaluation is good, so I have been looking forward to it. But now, after seeing my current aesthetic, I found that movies are very common. Isn&#39;t the film about the unlucky life of a group of scum? At the same time, we will reproduce extreme national and political themes such as patriotism and loyalty. Not at all fresh, not at all! Even if the history in the film is real, I can only feel that these people are unlucky. As for the sympathy for them, I will not have it, because they are not ordinary people, but criminals, which are sanctioned by law! In short, the film is not active from any angle, and &quot;politics&quot; is not correct. Of course, this is just my opinion. Maybe others don&#39;t think so. There are two parts to the main storyline of the movie. One is hard training and the other is friendship between companions. The first part has nothing to say, the movie is too much, I am already numb. Itâ€™s straightforward to say, Iâ€™m tired of watching these, I canâ€™t wait to fast forward when watching the film! This kind of plot can also attract people who watch a small amount of film. The second part is the friendship between the companions, that is, from confrontationI have seen a lot of these bridges. Because a large part of the menâ€™s play is such a plot, now what is the relationship between men and friendships, but what else can there be? Based on the above, it can be seen that this movie is a very patriotic commercial film. This kind of story is very much like the pre-titles written in the film: all the directors&#39; creation! Itâ€™s really nothing to watch! The theme of the film is very boring. It shows a very narrow patriotism. It is more straightforward to say that it is a gluten-like loyalty to the country. Of course, Koreans like to express this content very much, which can be felt in other movies, so I won&#39;t say much. There is no uniqueness in film shooting, and it can even be said to be tedious. Therefore, most of the time the film is very modest, and the boring people want to sleep, which makes people feel that this is a movie about warriors. Only the gun battle at the end of the film made me feel a little happy, &quot;I finally started playing!&quot; Therefore, the film is actually a &quot;literary drama&quot;. It is not a movie based on action. Those who only look at the film to see the film are disappointed. There is nothing to say about the actors, because there is no complete female character in the film, all men, dry. The director also had the courage to dare to shoot a movie without women, admire! admire! in conclusion. This is a patriotic film that is quite common in all aspects. It tells a period of meaninglessness in Korean history. It can only be used to understand Korean history and their over-expanding and narrow patriotism Silmido.2003.BluRay.720p.DTS. x264-CHD",movie

989,"The accidental applause of &quot;Red Flame Battlefield&quot; was also called sitting, so that several old gentlemen and old ladies were happy to close their mouths, so they rushed to drum up the second work of the series. This work adds Li Bingxian and Catherine Zeta Jones to the original team. It also adds a few new air to the new work. Since the success of the previous work, the natural base is much stronger. Just a happy, this group of old people can not hold their hands, the plot, the rhythm, all aspects of performance are out of control. Of course, some of these reasons are related to the director and the screenwriter, but they can&#39;t help but wonder if they are happy with them. Did they do something bad in the process? Inheriting the style of the predecessor, this crazy old play bones in the film, the nonsense, chaotic scenes are very strange HI turn the audience. In particular, I would like to praise Jones. The marriage problem with Spielberg made her difficult. The screen is still beautiful and sexy. This positive energy should applaud her. However, the most praiseworthy is Anthony Hopkins, the deductive master who shocked the audience in The Silent Lamb. In this film, he showed an alternative surprise in an &quot;old and unfair&quot; attitude. Many of them are the most dazzling, and even capture the brilliance of the protagonists. The image he created has a calmness in his madness, and he is deceitful in his anger, and he is still cruel when he is selling. It can be said that the old madman with complex personality and contradiction. However, played by Anthony, the characteristics of various violations reached a unity in him, and it was taken for granted that the vivid and lively image was impressive. Another newly joined actor should be more concerned by the Asian audience, this person is Lee Byung Hun. When he first appeared, the feeling of being chic and neat was amazing. &quot;Wow, this kid is not bad!&quot; The excitement will make the audience increase the expectation of his realization. This handsome guy is still a little more acquainted, HOLD can not stop the rhythm of the drama group, playing the killer from the male one At the beginning of the encounter, the performance was quite out of control, like a killing machine that could not stop the car. However, in the confrontation between Russia and Bruce Willis, there has been an unexpected change in character. Due to the fact that it has turned too hard, the character image has a serious fault problem, and the deduction is serious. The action film of the old actor of the cluster, and a &quot;Death Squad&quot;, led by Stallone. It is also a noisy, but purely tough guy style. Every hot scene has a kind of playThe madness of life, watching the audience are worried about who accidentally flashed the old arms and legs. There are not many professional action film actors in &quot;Red Flame Battlefield&quot;, so the fighting scene is dominated by the battle. The opponents are fighting IQ, and there are not many hard-playing plays, and they are mainly responsible for Bruce. The most obvious of these is the scientist played by Hopkins, clumsy behavior, slow movements, but with a mechanism to clean up a lot of people. Although not as hard as a hard fight, it will not make the audience bored. Since it is opportunistic, there must be places where the audience is not satisfied. The work is almost the part of the whole woman who is jealous and jealous, and is responsible for showing the whole piece of laughter. The two mature women&#39;s selling and playing treasures are old stalks, but they can bring some happiness to the audience after re-integration. All in all, &quot;Red Flame Battlefield 2&quot; is like a self-entertainment performance program launched by the Nursing Home for the annual celebration. The people who play are happy, and the people below are just as happy as they are, so there is no need to be true to the old people. Moreover, in this film they have tried their best and enjoyed it.",movie
990,"If it wasn&#39;t for the day&#39;s limit, I thought I would miss this book with such a cover and title. Generally Baidu, this book seems to be a collection of Wang Zhaoyang&#39;s &quot;New Century&quot; column. I suddenly understand some of the seemingly acquaintances in the text, maybe it has been read before. It is not an illusion of past and present. The words are back to the topic. Essays that have always been loved to see men, perhaps because of their common ground: clean and clear, logically clear. I am afraid to see a woman writing something similar, because I will always fall into the abyss of self-blame and self-sufficiency. We are both ourselves and deserved to be classified as a certain type of person. Going abroad and traveling around, this feeling is more obvious. From international students from China, Chinese who are mixed into the mainstream of the United States, to Chinese men in California. The society naturally gives us a place, good or bad. But even in the most vulnerable time, we can&#39;t hold these shells to complete self-identity. I am me, even if it is not the most beautiful fireworks. I am just me. Leo, Scorpio, Aries; Gao Shuaifu, Uncle, Silk, Master; Jews, Americans, Europeans, Chinese. We use a frame to cover the neighbors in the restaurant, the strangers who meet each other, and even those who are acquainted. Also covered by such a frame. Life seems to have become easier. It is not necessary to understand the life of that person and everything he has experienced. It seems that he can clearly understand what kind of person he is and whether he is trustworthy. There are always people who are unwilling to use their labels to post themselves and others and to make their lives complicated. The author&#39;s description of American life always reminds me of the story of The Road to Revolution. It looks so beautiful, villas, meadows, clean streets and blue skies. The facts are not so good. The so-called American dream is just the setting of some rules that make people the most human beings without prejudice. Freedom is of course not only the right to pursue success, but everyone has the right to be unhappy and unsuccessful. In a seemingly beautiful life, you can only move forward, and the destination you are going to is just material. After all, only the brave can hope for a candid life. Finally, for yourself, opportunity and action are the two most essential aspects of life. Before the heart is old, move forward in the direction of intuition and grasp all opportunities.",movie
991,"Recently, Douban movie WeChat recommended this movie twice. I feel that if I don&#39;t look at it again, I am embarrassed to say that I am a subscriber to Douban Movie WeChat. The romance of Jack and Rose is straightforward and tragic. I am very embarrassed to say it. I am obsessed with the Taiwan variety show. I can always hear some amazing words when I talk and laugh. For example, for a woman, there are 18 steps from A to B; for men, there is only one step. Yes, sometimes even a woman will marvel at how complicated a woman is. Young boys who are younger and younger will think that a beautiful creature is a woman (see &quot;Miracle&quot; for details). A man who really has a little experience will find that a woman is such a complex creature, indefinite, moody, and even aggressive and unreasonable. The woman&#39;s heart has 18 steps, but the man only sees the beginning and the result. However, as a woman who is a sentimental woman, there are also these 18 steps. There are so many places in the film that I want to talk about my understanding. First, the &quot;tough&quot; used by the neurological patient is used to define April. April will fall in love with Frank, not only because of his unrecognized skin. At the end of the drama, Frank rushed to the background with anxious eyes, how to think very warm. Whether it is because of intuition or long-term acquaintance, at least Frank can understand April&#39;s emotions. The first reaction was to go to her, comfort and companionship. The result turned into a quarrel. In the quarrel, Frank shouted: &quot;First.....Second...Third...&quot; You see, even if the man is angry, he has enough reason to sort out the rationale. . Men may wonder why April started this quarrel, (then for the brain). See the sixth episode of &quot;The Highest Divorce&quot;. &quot;I am sad, but I don&#39;t need comfort, especially your comfort. This makes me I feel like I am a person with imperfect behavior, and I can&#39;t even do my own career. Being comforted, I only feel like a weak person.&quot; The logic of sadness to the middle of comfort is not so direct, I need time and space to digest those sad. . April and Frank said that when I moved to Paris, I was almost moved to cry in front of the screen. How much understanding and love is needed to make April make such a decision, and how much understanding and love is needed to still believe that the people who live together day and night are indeed talented, deserve better and more. Let you endure 10 hours a day for our comfortable life together, that is selfish. To be honest, almost the first half of the movie was a laugh. How many blessings a man needs to reach a woman who loves you, knows you, and supports you. It is more about your life&#39;s ideal than the comfort of life. It is not known how much trust is needed to support a woman to make such a decision. As the story progresses to the end, I also believe that they are in love, even if both parties are derailed. Only April feels that he loves a man of great talent, and Frank is just an ordinary person, like everyone else, accepts the same values. There is nothing wrong with it. Poor Frank is just an ordinary person who doesn&#39;t want to admit that he is an ordinary person. Wife and child are cannon fodder, and they are always heroes and victims. This is the man under normal values. For the sake of family tolerance, Frank is playing such a role. Poor April looked away and believed that the man was very human. Maybe he started out, what is certain is that he must not be in the end. In a stalemate, life is moving in a direction that is unwilling to see. Life is already like this, but there is no way to solve it. This is to say that it will be very feminist. Since fleeing from the present life is the ideal of April, why not realize it yourself. First, she still loves Frank, even if she wants to be with him in pain; Second, in fact, many women now think this way, to realize the embarrassment and fantasies of the two people, but one who can finish these paths by himself, Already too capable to love yourself, and the ability to love others? To be honest, reason and feelings really stand on the opposite side. Regarding the plot, April did not commit suicide, she just wanted to have an abortion. Whether you go to Paris or not, he just wants to change this hopeless life. -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ------------------",movie

993,"&quot;Most people&#39;s love will develop from awkward to vigorous, and they will be flat because of marriage. Life can be calm, but life can&#39;t be without passion, lack of passion is sin! People in this life, composed of one piece after another, or black and white, Or color, black and white or color, is your own unique experience! Rothman Bridge, also because of Francesca and Robert Kincaid &quot;determined true love&quot;, exudes vitality and romance!&quot; No doubt, this is what I think The most incisive comment on this movie, at least, uttered my heart. Around 2008, I was a movie fan, the original intention was to make up for the classics that I had passed by, and &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; was one of the N classics I recorded at the time. Growing up slowly, maybe in those years, I saw this movie, and it is difficult to realize the meaning of it. Of course, this does not mean that I can profoundly understand it now, but at least I feel more than that. The classic tragedy can&#39;t be re-enacted. One is a sincere love, and the other is a restrained restraint. For a long time, I have felt the movie I saw before. There is almost no tragedy for this. The taboo of the film&#39;s extramarital affairs is The theme, with the children&#39;s memories of the mother&#39;s diary as the main line, tells the story of a family&#39;s Francesca, who spent five days in the family out, and the loved ones in this life, who eventually failed to get together. When I was watching a movie, I was thinking, why should people be loyal to others? Is it loyal to marriage, there is no love? Is this a secular subjective concept or an objective law of things? It is said that marriage is the grave of love. I can&#39;t help but ask, the fact is this. So we think so, or do we think so, so things become like this? I still believe in love. As I said before, life can&#39;t be without passion. Without passion, it is sin! Life includes marriage, including love, including everything in life that you radiate. I used to be warm in my heart: the sun was gentle and the breeze was slow. It happened that Francisco was knocking on the mat outside. It happened that Robert drove past her door at this time. There could be no passers-by on the bridge. The blue sky was blue, the wheat field was yellow, and the wildflowers were just under the bridge. It happens that this sentiment is scattered among the two. Parting makes me feel painful: it must be accidental, there must be heavy rain, there must be a distance, just as her husband is around, there must be a red light, and it is the stagnation of the front and rear cars, making people suffocate. I cried, especially after turning green, she put her hand on the door handle, andThe husband said around him, &quot;Come on!&quot;, and the car in front did not move. The time is like stopping. I can feel the activity of the protagonist. It is intense love and restraint. Perhaps it is always the best that can&#39;t be obtained. It seems that this is the fundamental attribute of human beings. There is nothing wrong with love, no responsibility is wrong, no freedom is wrong, and happiness is not wrong. It can also be seen from the emotions of Francisco&#39;s children. In the end, they understood the mother and executed the mother&#39;s will. Both of them have apologized for the love that once disgusted. I think this is the maximum that a mother with a special story can influence her children. Should we have our own understanding in our hearts? When the ashes of the heroine were scattered from the son to the bridge of Madison, I cried again and forgive my sentimentality. I just thought that her life was full. She gave her life to her family before her death, and gave her life after her death. Her love. See you at first sight.

995,"In order to distinguish between a wife and a mistress, I know that this is not a thriller. However, the female host&#39;s make-up painting scares the dead, and at night, one person at home sees this disharmony and affects sleep. Because there are no lines and no names, I don&#39;t know how to distinguish these four characters. Movies without lines are the most horrible. Kim Kiddâ€™s drama is too much to suggest, and incomprehensible. The wife is mad to the loss of the mother&#39;s essence to understand incompetence, is it the son&#39;s behavior to stimulate her? The Buddha image that appears from time to time is incompetent. On the one hand, it is the devout faith of one side. It is even more ironic that the knife is hidden under the Buddha statue. You are really evil when you are a gold director. The mistress seduce the woman&#39;s son in order to retaliate against the husband. It is understandable, but let the actress split the two corners and one wife, a wife, is completely trying to test the acting skills. How good is a young boy who plays his son? Do you have a shadow when playing this play? Once again, I sighed that a line was not really heart-warming. The mistress was raped. Could it be that Kimâ€™s director expressed all the mistresses in real life? It seems that her injuries are not sympathized? The husband raised his gun and wanted to commit suicide and softly let go. The sonâ€™s weakness may be to inherit him, and the madness seems to inherit the mother. On the night of the early winter, one person looks at this heart more and more cold, the pleasure of self-torture can be understood, and the pain and happiness after the wound is understandable. Because film is an art, art can be exaggerated, so some unreasonable plots are also in line. The more I saw it, the more a mime, the son was released, the father gave him a stone as a gift, and the son shyly smiled. It was like the father gave a young son a set in real life, then the son shyly laughed, everything is so Beautiful. Ps. amount. The filming of a small age is such a good welfare, what does the mother say? The mistress and son revenge together looks and inspirational, and the mistress&#39;s eyes are exactly the same as the wife at the time. Three people, you hit me, I love you, you fan, my last emotional burst is very warm. When my sonâ€™s surgery was successful but the effect was not there, a lyric appeared in my mind and moved to cheer for the new power! ! When the son was reacted by his mother&#39;s face, the family of three was shocked. At this time, as the wife&#39;s mother, the mother of the mother really wanted to slap her. The actress is more vivid, and the story is really complicated and complicated. The mistress is not the same as your mother. How did you react? I thought of a line. Meng Meng. Stand up~ a family of three bitter dramasLove began again, such a perverted family and plot, although I know that Kim has been cruel and perverted, but the story is comparable to the mud xx movie. The woman is not worthy of sympathy at least, at least in the eyes of my normal person, I know why this is the first time, your sister. Finally, as the husband of the husband&#39;s role, this time the big man noticed the rise, and suddenly there was a good husband&#39;s responsibility? At this time, the little punk of the soy sauce character became a masochistic mad, and I sighed in the sky~ the morbid person is a perverted story. The husband took the gun for the third time. Nima. You are open. Biang! A gunshot! Death two ~ who saw the gun? Who killed who? Is it all suicide? At this time, the son took the gun, and the action was exactly the same as his father. .

This film educates the world, it is best not to have extramarital affairs, and the extramarital affairs should not be discovered by children and wives. In the end, don&#39;t injure people, because you always have to pay back, it is best not to be a mistress, because you are young and beautiful, you have to leave the goods. What. . . .

997,"The first time I knew Chen Tianxing was in his movie &quot;Nuclear Sticks&quot;. The film completely ignored the plot, all the way to the end, and finally gave a nonsense statement, a lot of early Zhang Jian what they mean?? The film 70% of the time for martial arts action. Obviously, this kind of shooting is no longer a blockbuster. The movie &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; was starred and directed by Chen Tianxing. Of course, the film has a Hong Kong team participation component. The film is obviously higher than the nunchaku movie in the narrative rhythm and story arrangement. Chen Tianxingâ€™s film has a tribute to Bruce Lee. Decades ago, Bruce Lee did play a piece of the world in the film circle. After Bruce Lee, several Hong Kong stars, such as Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Donnie Yen, also made great achievements. Kung Fu movies have long existed as a type of film. Of course, the old martial arts director Xu Ke has used the sci-fi way to let Donnie Yen go to the hurricane in space. Jackie Chan has to jump into the volcano, and the real kung fu movie is obviously weak. The clothes that Chen Tianxing took over, there are not many foods that can be found inside. Judging from the martial arts, &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; apparently lost its &quot;King Kong King&quot; released a few months ago because of cost constraints. Judging from the rhythm of the script story, there is no such thing as the affectionate inspiration of Guild Wars. If it is not easy to talk about the stars, this is a warm theme. There is still a certain gap with &quot;After Gorgeous&quot;. If you look at the spoiled wife after the rise of the literary male, the gap between it and the &quot;Floating City Tycoon&quot; is also clear. However, &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; was born in this embarrassing situation. For movies that have some problems with this narrative structure and story logic, we don&#39;t have to be anxious to criticize. We may wish to allow the existence of film diversity with a tolerant attitude. Chen Tianxing is still in the growth stage, and &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; should be affirmed better than &quot;Gallows.&quot; Under the premise of kung fu movies, Chen Tianxing dared to take martial arts movies, and natural kung fu was outside the movie. This point, we know the various titles of Baidu Chen Tianxing. After the Bruce Lee era, the film relied on small-cost action shooting, and it was already unable to raise the interest of the audience. We must face the fact that the film is first and foremost an industrial production method. Any industry, in the face of technology, has to bow, and the film is no exception. The kung fu movie is microscopic, which is the fading of the individual&#39;s ability. In the future, it is an inevitable trend for individual individuals to give way to collective technology. And any kung fu movie must face a fundamental problem? Kung Fu is definitely not the only Kung Fu movie.Watching and telling good stories is more important than playing martial arts. Obviously, &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; pays more attention to this than &quot;Nuclear&quot;. Therefore, we have seen more literary plays in the film, although Chen Tianxingâ€™s acting in the literary drama still needs some time to temper. In this way, we can ask, where is the fundamental point of the combination of the drama and the martial arts? The literary drama provides a basis for the martial arts. In other words, the drama should explain why it is played. &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot; clarifies this point, but the value points found for &quot;hit&quot; are obviously outdated. They fight for the happiness of their girlfriends, fight for their dreams, and fight for the national enthusiasm of rebuilding Chinese kung fu... These routines have been used in past Kung Fu movies. Chen Tianxing did not find a script platform to better show his efforts. Judging from the martial arts style of Chen Tianxing, this actor has certain potential. If he can encounter excellent scripts and excellent directors, he can be tempered. As one of the important actors in the type of film, Chen Tianxing, there are reasons to be focused on by fans.

998,"The film is about the same time as the tears of a liter of tears. Ya also left me a liter of tears, but Aki did not let a tear. She took her hat, sat at the airport, waited for a plane that would never take off, and then told her that she couldn&#39;t fly anymore. She stares in desperate eyes, grabs the person who loves her, helps me, I know I have no chance anymore. And those who love her can only watch her fall, and time and life are such cruel things. I didn&#39;t cry at all, just felt powerless and helpless, the kind of desperate touch. Under the spit, when the male owner was young, he couldnâ€™t bear to look straight, which caused me to play a little.",movie
999,"I remember when I was a child, the teacher always took the trouble to emphasize: &quot;Students, you must first raise your hand to tell the teacher first, and the teacher can agree to do it.&quot; In this way, Sanjiu was also included in the teacher&#39;s jurisdiction. Therefore, the class often falls into a state of incitement after the words &quot;teacher...to pull&quot;. It is not a hilarious state, because the teacher has already used his monster-like eyes to kill the laughter in the bud. &quot;Go, remember, I will say &#39;teacher, I want to go to the bathroom&#39; later. Remember?&quot; The teacher is always patient as a repeater. â€œReport the teacher, remember.â€ The students are always confident. &quot;Teacher...going to the toilet&quot;, &quot;teacher, I want to pull&quot; such reports are still endless, and the teacher&#39;s patience is really worthy of the word &quot;gardener&quot;. Yes, who will have to say the words of the brain when the belly bursts quickly and the chrysanthemums are quick to break? For example, when people come to the XX00 climax, they will only shout &quot;Hmm...ah...so cool&quot;, but not elegant: &quot;Dear, I want to climax.&quot; This mode has been running very much. Ok, until once... &quot;Teacher, I want to pull... Teacher... Teacher... Old...&quot; The voice gradually began to tremble, with a painful expression, a swifting right hand, like a farewell Friends. It is a pity that the voice is concealed in the sound of reading one after another, and the waving arm is even more bleak. Finally, after a series of &quot;fluttering&quot; sounds, everything went to calm. This obedient child is me. In the movie, the square gun was forced to lose the small scorpion when he first entered the kindergarten. No matter how struggling and crying, the rules will never leave. Here, the rice soup has to be left-handed, the right hand is raised, and the toilet is arranged in a line, and the toilet is not allowed to go to the toilet. Otherwise, the little red flower is buckled (this is the only important thing here). The heinous behavior of bedwetting is naturally also to be deducted. The nature of the guns that were not controlled by nature was a thorn. When they climbed to the window, they shook their eyes at the teacher. After a while, they took the opportunity to take off the little girlâ€™s pants and make a play. Even after a teacher dressed up as an orangutan, he successfully spread the rumor that the teacher is a monster, which led everyone to decide to get rid of the teacher. Of course, all this is tossed in the eyes of teachers and kindergarten directors.By turning over, you can calm everything down. Finally, after the unforgivable swearing of &quot;grass mud horse&quot; broke out, the square gun was confined, lonely, struggling, fear, but no regrets. Finally, the confinement was lifted, and the guns ran into the team of friends. He suddenly found out that he was so noisy and tossed. After all, he was alone. The friends had become accustomed to no longer paying attention to him, but he was only briefly stunned and fled quickly. The other side. Entered the world outside the long-awaited kindergarten. The rushing man finally stopped in front of a pair of adult queues with big red flowers and orderly. Yes, when I grew up, I just changed the little red flower into a big red flower. &quot;Why is this all the case? Why are the adults also like this?&quot; I think that the last lost guns on the side of the stone should have only doubts that cannot be solved. &quot;I want to be free, I want to break free from bondage, for freedom, I would rather die...&quot; &quot;No rules are not square, and you are coming, the world is still not messed up...&quot; Two sets of opposite ideas have been colliding, No matter what. I would like to quote the words of the kindergarten directorâ€™s gun. &quot;You donâ€™t think that leaving kindergarten is a very happy thing. In fact, kindergarten is the happiest and most carefree time of your life. In the future, you want to Back, I can&#39;t come back. When you grow up, you will understand. &quot;You only need to obey the kindergarten, and when you grow up, you have to listen first.&quot; Rules are everywhere, and there are rules in circles. People can&#39;t live alone, they can only break free from one circle and jump into another. However, it is ridiculous to see how the regulations can not be used during the meal. In the movie, when the gun was released, the fart was forcibly pulled to pull, what is the relationship between fart and squatting? There is a fart relationship. You said that my brother can&#39;t marry my sister, I will support my hands, because their crystallization will be a biological accident; now you have to force me to agree that the same-sex combination has a big deal, I really want to ask for a reason; you I am not allowed to seduce the masses on the Internet and filthy the government. I can barely accept it. But if you look at the film and solve the physiological problems, you will have to interfere. I will feel that someone has forced the hand into my crotch. You know, this feeling is Very bad. The rule is not the key. The key is the boundary of the rule. If the pipe is too wide, it will inevitably lead to partial escape.After all, not everyone is born a slave. The interpersonal relationship in the 1950s and 1960s looks very beautiful; the yield is 30,000 jin, which looks beautiful; Chinaâ€™s GDP looks beautiful; the sight of the leaderâ€™s inspection looks beautiful; the financial statements of listed companies It looks beautiful; the outside world looks beautiful... But I only love the story behind the beauty, because it is closer to reality, where it can return to reason. The well-trimmed flower buds are neat and elegant, look pleasing to the eye, let the wild grasses flow freely, messy and boring. Why? Because flowers and plants are born for us to play.",movie
