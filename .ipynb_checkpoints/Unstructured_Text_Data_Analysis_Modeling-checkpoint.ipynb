       "'About the shop: There is a restaurant in Soi Langsuan (Road) inside of Luxx Hotel. The dÃ©cor of the restaurant: decorated in a rustic style, white walls, glass tables, red chairs, parquet floors, dim lights open at night, the romantic atmosphere: Duck l&#39;orange Pork Wellington and French onion soup. Average Price: 250-450 Baht Food Review: Duck l&#39;orange (455) Duck breast sliced Pork Wellington (445) is a piece of tender pork stuffed with stuffing and wrapped in a thin pastry and then baked to serve with the sauce. Duck roll (285) is a Duck wrapped with vegetables and dough wrap not much delicious French onion soup (235) Sweet taste Garnish with cheese Bake Scallop (225) is a scallop in a thick cream with cheese. Serve with a thin toast to eat together. Score by topic: &lt;Atmosphere&gt; 8/10 Atmosphere nice romantic &lt;food taste&gt; 7/10&lt;Service&gt; 9/10 Good service, good food recommendation &lt;Value&gt; 6/10 price is quite expensive and about 1,000 baht if not ordered the original special. Conclusion: The atmosphere is good, some delicious food. Three and a half stars for some delicious food. Note: This review is for personal use only. We do not like it. If not, please forgive me. I think that is one comment. To win the competition. I have a very good restaurant now. Thank you'"
